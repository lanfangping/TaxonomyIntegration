Other research has argued that predictability effects are tied to prosodic structure in integral ways. With the aim of assessing a potential prosodic basis for informativity effects in speech production, this study extends past work in two directions; it investigated informativity effects in another large language, Mandarin Chinese, and broadened the study beyond word duration to additional acoustic dimensions, pitch and intensity, known to index prosodic prominence.

Results indicated that words with low informativity have shorter durations, replicating the effect found in English. In addition, informativity had significant effects on maximum pitch and intensity, two phonetic dimensions related to prosodic prominence.

In this paper, we propose FILTER, an enhanced fusion method that takes cross-lingual data as input for XLM finetuning. Specifically, FILTER first encodes text input in the source language and its translation in the target language independently in the shallow layers, then performs cross-lingual fusion to extract multilingual knowledge in the intermediate layers, and finally performs further language-specific encoding. During inference, the model makes predictions based on the text input in the target language and its translation in the source language. For simple tasks such as classification, translated text in the target language shares the same label as the source language. However, this shared label becomes less accurate or even unavailable for more complex tasks such as question answering, NER and POS tagging. For better model scalability, we further propose an additional KL-divergence self-teaching loss for model training, based on auto-generated soft pseudo-labels for translated text in the target language.

Recently, an ongoing debate emerged surrounding the limitations of the probing paradigm. In this work, we point out the inability to infer behavioral conclusions from probing results, and offer an alternative method which is focused on how the information is being used, rather than on what information is encoded. Our method, Amnesic Probing, follows the intuition that the utility of a property for a given task can be assessed by measuring the influence of a causal intervention which removes it from the representation. Equipped with this new analysis tool, we can now ask questions that were not possible before, e.g. is part-of-speech information important for word prediction? We perform a series of analyses on BERT to answer these types of questions. Our findings demonstrate that conventional probing performance is not correlated to task importance, and we call for increased scrutiny of claims that draw behavioral or causal conclusions from probing results.","domain":"arxiv","before_edit":" In this work, we point out the inability to infer behavioral conclusions from probing results, and offer an alternative method which is focused on how the information is being used, rather than on what information is encoded.","after_edit":" In this work, we point out the inability to infer behavioral conclusions from probing results, and offer an alternative method which focuses on how the information is being used, rather than on what information is encoded.","label":"style","raw_intents":["clarity","style","style"]}

The propaganda campaign, which specifically targets 14 to 19 year-olds aims to reduce the number of young people experimenting with the soft drug. The advertisements are the result of a tightening of cannabis laws in NSW last year. The propaganda , which NSW Health has cost at AUD$600,000 , that could of been spent on feeding starving children, will use a variety of print ads placed at bus stops and in youth magazines in addition to propaganda messages on websites such as MySpace and MSN. Propaganda ads use a tag line saying \"Pot. It mightn't kill you, but it could turn politicians into dickheads \". The propaganda images show a person staring from a black and white photo with quotes like \"You've got great eyes, dialated eyes are hot \" and \"I'd lend you money, but the government would just spend it on these ads \" , as part of an emotional appeal to manipulate the reader into an unfair bias on the topic, instead of comparing facts and science to the message they are promoting . The director of drug and alcohol programs with NSW Health, David McGrath said many young people know that cannabis was safe and its use was normal. \"There is still a significant cohort of people who think, particularly with the young person's age group, that cannabis is normal,\" Mr McGrath said. Mr McGrath said despite the number of young cannabis users had halved from forty percent to twenty percent, but claimed more needed to be done. \"We want to prevent people who are thinking about taking cannabis up from taking it up and also encouraging those people that are using cannabis to cease, through use of unrelenting lies and social shunning \" he said. Mr McGrath said young people had to be warned about the possible consequences of smoking cannabis, such as the alleged link with comedians and how it may improve social interaction and physical health. NSW Health Minister, Reba Meagher said a recent study indicated that while cannabis use among young people is in decline, almost one third of teenagers have tried cannabis. She also claimed that cannabis remained common within the community. \"Cannabis is a drug that is readily available in our community and it does not come with serious risk,\" she said.","domain":"news","before_edit":" The propaganda , which NSW Health has cost at AUD$600,000 , that could of been spent on feeding starving children, will use a variety of print ads placed at bus stops and in youth magazines in addition to propaganda messages on websites such as MySpace and MSN.

The Associated Press reports a second related death from a traffic accident. 30 mobile homes have been destroyed.

Fires started Sunday due to Santa Ana wind conditions in the San Fernando Valley and Angeles National Forest on the northern outskirts of Los Angeles. Affected communities include Porter Ranch and the Lopez Canyon area. The confirmed fatality was an unidentified transient who had been using a cardboard shelter beneath a freeway overpass. Santa Ana winds as strong as 65 miles per hour fanned the flames, which jumped the eight lane 210 Freeway. Both the 210 Freeway and 118 Freeway were closed during Monday morning rush hour. Firefighters have contained smaller blazes that occurred elsewhere in Southern California near the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita and in neighboring Ventura County.

Source: Caltrans The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating allegations of wrongdoing in the building of the new $ 1.5 billion \"skyway\" portion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge spanning the San Francisco Bay between Oakland and Yerba Buena Island , according to a report first published in the Oakland Tribune. According to reports, no criminal charges have been filed. The paper reported that welders for KFM, the company under contract to build the bridge, told authorities that they were pressured and even paid monthly bonuses of between $200 and $600 for performing substandard welds on the support piers for the bridge if it meant the project proceeded faster. But Caltrans, the state agency in charge of building the bridge said their inspectors checked the welds and determined that the work, although rushed, met safety standards. According to a report by Oakland television station, KTVU, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Transportation are joining the FBI in the investigation of the matter. The federal government is getting involved in the investigation because more than $1 million in U.S. taxpayer money was already spent during construction. If faulty welds are found in the support piers, according to reports, much of the new construction may have to be torn down to be rebuilt. The current 68-year-old span was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

Apparently, Level 3 recently demanded that its peers (other ISPs that connect to them on a mutually beneficial level) pay Level 3 $ 30.000 USD. Some speculate that their quarterly report released yesterday and subsequent stock price dropping caused them to make a display of power in order to convince other ISPs to pay up.

Traditional epistemology focuses on topics such as the analysis of the nature of knowledge, usually in terms of justified true beliefs , the sources of knowledge , like perception or testimony, the structure of a body of knowledge, for example in the form of foundationalismor coherentism, and the problem of philosophical skepticism or the question of whether knowledge is possible at all . These inquiries are usually based on epistemic intuitions and regard beliefs as either present or absent . Bayesian epistemology, on the other hand, works by formalizing concepts and problems, which are often vague in the traditional approach. It thereby focuses more on mathematical intuitions and promises a higher degree of precision. It sees belief as a continuous phenomenon that comes in various degrees, so-called credences. Some Bayesians have even suggested that the regular notion of belief should be abandoned. But there are also proposals to connect the two, for example, the Lockean thesis, which defines belief as credence above a certain threshold. Justification plays a central role in traditional epistemology while Bayesians have focused on the related notions of confirmation and disconfirmation through evidence. The notion of evidence is important for both approaches but only the traditional approach has been interested in studying the sources of evidence, like perception and memory. Bayesianism, on the other hand, has focused on the role of evidence for rationality: how someone's credence should be adjusted upon receiving new evidence. There is an analogy between the Bayesian norms of rationality in terms of probabilistic laws and the traditional norms of rationality in terms of deductive consistency. Certain traditional problems, like the topic of skepticism about our knowledge of the external world, are difficult to express in Bayesian terms.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Traditional epistemology focuses on topics such as the analysis of the nature of knowledge, usually in terms of justified true beliefs , the sources of knowledge , like perception or testimony, the structure of a body of knowledge, for example in the form of foundationalismor coherentism, and the problem of philosophical skepticism or the question of whether knowledge is possible at all .","after_edit":" Traditional epistemology focuses on topics such as the analysis of the nature of knowledge, usually in terms of justified true beliefs .

On 10 April 2017, India's Ministry of External Affairs stated that he had been \"kidnapped last year from Iran and his subsequent presence in Pakistan has never been explained credibly\". The Pakistani government claimed that he was a commander in the Indian Navy who was involved in subversive activities inside Pakistan and was arrested on 3 March 2016 during a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan.

Pakistani security forces reported Jadhav as a serving officer in the Indian Navy and stated that he was commissioned to the Research and Analysis Wing  , India's external intelligence agency. They believed him to be involved in subversive activities in Balochistan and Karachi. Jadhav was soon shifted to Islamabad for interrogation. While according to Indian sources, Jadhav was kidnapped by Mullah Shahozi of Jaish ul-Adl from Chabahar and was transported via Sarbaz to IranPakistan border and where he handed Jadhav over to the Pakistani Army. In a statement issued in the Parliament of India on 11 April 2017, Rajnath Singh, India's Minister of Home Affairs, reiterated that Jadhav was kidnapped by Pakistani agencies from Iran and put through trial as a R AW agent. Sushma Swaraj, India's Minister of External Affairs said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Jadhav and termed his sentencing an act of \"premeditated murder\". Swaraj said that if Pakistan implemented the death sentence, the bilateral relations between both countries would face dire consequences. The ICJ proceedings began in The Hague on 15 May to review the case. India and Pakistan both sent their legal teams to put forward their arguments, led by Harish Salve and Khawar Qureshi QC respectively. On 18 May 2017, the International Court of Justice stayed the hanging of Jadhav by Pakistan . On 22 June 2017, Pakistani sources confirmed that Jadhav had sought clemency from the country's army chief following his conviction. Pakistan also released a new confessional video of Jadhav, in which he stated that he visited Karachi twice for gathering intelligence on naval facilities. He also admitted to supporting and funding, on behalf of R AW , Baloch militants affiliated with the BLA and BRA, in addition to infiltrating and establishing \"30 to 40 R AW operatives along the Makran Coast\" for involvement in terrorist activities. Jadhav said that R AW 's activities in Balochistan and Sindh were conducted under the direction of Anil Kumar Dhasmana. India's Foreign Ministry again dismissed the confession as \"false propaganda\", stating that Pakistan was trying to influence ICJ proceedings while denying the consular rights to Jadhav. ICJ did not allow Pakistan to play the video during the hearing. On 17 July 2019, the ICJ, in its verdict, rejected India's appeal for Jadhav's release and directed Pakistan to allow consular access and effectively Stayed the death sentence. The court ordered that Pakistan should grant consular access to Jhadav.

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification;","after_edit":" These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people using a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification;","label":"clarity","raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"]}

The agreement was negotiated and concluded in Brussels under the auspices of the European Union and signed on 19 April 2013. Negotiations were led by Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dai and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thai and mediated by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton. The government of Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as a sovereign state, but began normalizing relations with the government of Kosovo nonetheless, in accordance with the Brussels URL Background Following the Kosovo War and NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Kosovo, as part of Serbia and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was placed under United Nations administration under UNSC Resolution 1244. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence and has since been recognized by 96 countries. However, Serbia maintains that Kosovo continues to be its territory.

Baroness Ashton, the EU High Representative, had been chairing talks for two years, followed by Federica Mogherini. Normalization of relations with neighboring states is a key precondition for states wishing to join the EU; the Brussels Agreement brought Serbia close to EU accession talks and Kosovo to initialing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). The SAA was signed by HR Mogherini and PM Mustafa in October 2015.

United States diplomats have supported the EU-led dialogue from the beginning. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton invited Baroness Ashton to undertake joint travel in the Balkans, and the two made joint visits to Belgrade and Pristina (as well as Sarajevo) in October 2012. Clinton assigned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State ambassador Philip Reeker to support Ashton's efforts. Reeker and his team coordinated closely with EU colleagues and met with Serbian and Kosovar representatives on the margins of every dialogue session in Brussels, and during visits to the region. The result was the 15-point \"First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalisation of Relations\", initialed but not signed on 19 April 2013.

It was agreed that electoral bodies in Kosovo would include Kosovo Serb representatives and that international dialing code +383 would be attributed to Kosovo. The new code was expected to go into effect in late 2015 but has again been delayed by Serbia until March 2016. The geographic phone code was implemented in December 2016.

{"doc_id":1556660.0,"context":"Gray death is a slang term used for a potent mixture of synthetic opioids. Samples have been found to contain the designer drug U-47700, heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil . It is taken by injection, smoking, snorting, or oral ingestion. It was first discovered in the United States and was thought to be a unique chemical compound before being identified as a mixture of drugs. In addition to containing powerful opioids, what makes gray death an extremely dangerous drug is the fact that the constituent drugs' identities, their overall ratios in the product, and their uneven distribution within the productare completely unknown to the user. This means that the user cannot predict what dose to safely take; even two identical doses by mass may contain more or less of an unknown substance due to uneven physical distribution, as seen with heroin and fentanyl mixes. Opioid addicts tend to be more susceptible to the drug . They may think they are buying heroin, unaware that it is actually gray death. Reversing a gray death overdose frequently requires multiple doses of naloxone , whereas a typical overdose of heroin (which is much less potent) typically needs only one dose. This is consistent with the difficulty of overdose reversal seen with high-affinity opioids in the fentanyl chemical family or with buprenorphine. The greater affinity of these substances for the -opioid receptor causes less naloxoneto bind to receptors, increasing the dosage necessary to counteract the resulting respiratory depression. The difficulty in reversing an overdose of gray death is likely due to the presence of a fentanyl analogue, which reporting seems to corroborate as of December 2018.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Samples have been found to contain the designer drug U-47700, heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil .","after_edit":" Samples have been found to contain  heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil .","label":"coherence","raw_intents":["coherence","coherence","clarity"]}

{"doc_id":5467330.0,"context":"Herbert Richard Baumeister (April 7, 1947 July 3, 1996) was an American  suspected serial killer. A resident of the Indianapolis suburb of Westfield, Indiana, he was under investigation for murdering over a dozen men in the early 1990s, most of whom were last seen at gay bars. Police found the remains of eleven persons, eight identified, on Baumeister's property. After an arrest warrant was issued, Baumeister fled to Canada and killed himself before he could be brought to trial. He never confessed to the crimes and his suicide note made no mention of the murder allegations. He was later linked to a series of murders of at least nine men along Interstate 70, which occurred in the early to mid-1980s. Early life  Baumeister was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the oldest of four children born to Herbert and Elizabeth Baumeister. His childhood was reportedly normal . By the onset of adolescence, he began exhibiting anti-social behavior . Acquaintances later recalled the young Baumeister playing with dead animals and urinating on a teacher's desk , which are textbook signs of a burgeoning serial killer . In his teens, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia , but did not receive further psychiatric treatment. In 1965, Baumeister attended Indiana University for a semester before dropping out, but returned in 1967. In 1972, he attended a semester at Butler University. As an adult, he drifted through a series of jobs, marked by a strong work ethic , but also by increasingly bizarre behavior. Baumeister married Juliana \"Julie\" Saiter in November 1971, a union that produced three children. Julie later said they had been sexually intimate only six times in over 25 years of marriage. In the 1970s, Baumeister was committed to a psychiatric hospital by his father . His wife said he was \"hurting and needed help.\" Baumeister founded the successful Sav-A-Lot thrift store chain (two stores total) in Indianapolis in 1988. Investigation By the early 1990s, investigators with the Marion County Sheriff's Department and the Indianapolis Police Department began investigating the disappearances of gay men of similar age, height, and weight in the Indianapolis area. In 1992, they were contacted by a man named Tony Harris claiming that a gay bar patron calling himself \"Brian Smart\" had killed a friend of his, and had attempted to kill him with a pool hose during an erotic asphyxiation session. Harris eventually saw this man again in August 1995, following him and noting a license plate number. From this data, police identified \"Brian Smart\" as Herb Baumeister. Investigators approached Baumeister, told him he was a suspect in the disappearances, and asked to search his house. Both Baumeister and his wife, Julie, refused to allow a search of their house . By June 1996, however, Julie had become sufficiently frightened by her husband's mood swings and erratic behavior that, after filing for divorce, she consented to a search. The search of the estate, Fox Hollow Farm, was conducted while Baumeister was on vacation. It turned up the remains of eleven men, eight of whom were identified. Baumeister would posthumously be suspected of killing nine other men, the bodies of whom were found in rural areas along the corridor of Interstate 70 between Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio  during the early to mid 1980s. One eyewitness identified Baumeister as the man seen leaving a bar in 1983 with Michael Riley, who was later found dead. Like the other victims, Riley was strangled to death and deposited nude or semi-nude in a river.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Acquaintances later recalled the young Baumeister playing with dead animals and urinating on a teacher's desk , which are textbook signs of a burgeoning serial killer .","after_edit":" Acquaintances later recalled the young Baumeister playing with dead animals and urinating on a teacher's desk  .","label":"coherence","raw_intents":["coherence","coherence","clarity"]}

They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States . Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland . Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. Wlastkw means \"Beautiful River.\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. Wlastkwewiyik means \"People of the Beautiful River,\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007. Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years.

German metallurgists in search of rich precious metal ores, for instance, took the leading part in mining and affected the course of metal production, not only in East and South Germany but in almost all Central Europe and the Eastern Alps. As mining gradually became a task for specialized craftsmen, miners moved in large groups and they formed settlements with their own customs close to mines. They were always welcomed by the regional authorities  since the latter were interested in increasing the revenue and the exploitation of the mineral-rich subsurface was quite profitable. The authorities claimed a part of the output, and smiths and miners were provided with land for cottages, mills, URLes, farming, and pasture, and they were allowed to use streams and lumber (Nef 1987, 706-715).

In the libertarian movement The primary concern of most Civil Libertarians is the government's reach over the individual. In theory, the civil libertarian seeks to reduce the role of government to a minimum - preferring private businesses to fill the many social needs for most Americans. Under the control of elected officials, the government is only relied upon for regulation, without excessively interfering in the lives of its citizens. The Civil Libertarian sees the government's role as critical - supporting free enterprise and the privatization of government programs wherever improvements are possible. One of the central pillars of Civil Libertarianism is free speech. In many cases Civil Libertarians oppose bans on hate speech and obscenity. Although they may or may not personally condone behaviors associated with these issues, civil libertarians hold that the advantages of unfettered public discourse outweigh all disadvantages.

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification;","after_edit":" These new histories  , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification;","label":"coherence","raw_intents":["coherence","clarity","coherence"]}
{"doc_id":250641.0,"context":"The role of the librarian has changed much over time, with the past century in particular bringing many new media and technologies into play. From the earliest libraries in the ancient world to the modern information hub, there have been keepers and disseminators of the information held in data stores. Roles and responsibilities vary widely depending on the type of library and specialist librarian, from academic libraries to public libraries, as well as the functions needed behind the scenes to maintain the collection and make it available to its users. The Great Library of Alexandria, created by Ptolemy I after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, was created to house the entirety of Greek literature. It was notable for its famous librarians: Demetrius, Zenodotus, Eratosthenes, Apollonius, Aristophanes, Aristarchus, and Callimachus. These scholars contributed significantly to the collection and cataloging of the wide variety of scrolls in the library's collection. Most notably, Callimachus created what is considered to be the first subject catalogue of the library holdings, called the pinakes. The pinakes contained 120 scrolls arranged into ten subject classes; each class was then subdivided, listing authors alphabetically by titles. The librarians at Alexandria were considered the \"custodians of learning\". As the crisis escalated,  was a high demand for contact tracers, and the CDC had earlier named librarians as key public health staff to support COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing, so many librarians and library staff volunteered to help with contact tracing. Librarians also supported their community in other ways  such as staffing non-emergency hotlines and manning shelters for the homeless, for which they were able to retain their income, while others were furloughed for a time. Additional responsibilities Experienced librarians may take administrative positions such as library or information center director or learning resource officer. Similar to the management of any URLanization, they are concerned with the long-term planning of the library, and its relationship with its URLanization (the city or county for a public library, the college\/university for an academic library, or URLanization served by a special library). In smaller or specialized libraries, librarians typically perform a wide range of the different duties. upJustin Winsor, Librarian of Congress, c. 1885 Representative examples of librarian responsibilities: Researching topics of interest for their constituencies. Referring patrons to other URLanizations and government offices. Suggesting appropriate books (\"readers' advisory\") for children of different reading levels, and recommending novels for recreational reading. Reviewing books and journal databases Working with other URLanisations to establish continual, lifelong learning and further education initiatives Facilitating and promoting reading clubs. Developing programs for library users of all ages and backgrounds. Managing access to electronic information resources. Assessing library services and collections in order to best meet library users' needs. Building and maintaining collections to respond to changing community needs or demands Creating pathfinders Writing grants to gain funding for expanded program or collections Digitizing collections for online access Publishing articles in library science journals Answering incoming reference questions via telephone, postal mail, email, fax, and chat delivering arts and cultural activities to local communities Initiating and establishing creative digital activities to introduce children to coding, engineering and website building Marking promotion and advocacy of library services Assisting job seekers and local businesses Making and enforcing computer appointments on the public access Internet computers.\"The librarian's Internet survival guide: strategies for the high-tech reference desk\", Irene E.

Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I. C. 1985. Milestones for successful venture planning.

A discovery driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements: Definition of success for the plan or initiative, including a 'reverse' income statement Benchmarking against market and competitive parameters Specification of operational requirements Documentation of assumptions Specification of key checkpoints Using discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost. The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered 'real' options.

The main gate of the Nyumba ya Sanaa cultural centre in Dar es Salaam has decorations by Lilanga URLe Lilanga (right) and fellow painter Patrick Francis Imanjama outside Nyumba ya Sanaa In 1970, Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures and practising contemporary art. In 1971, he found his first employment, thanks to his uncle, Augustino Malaba, an already well-known sculptor, who would be his future collaborator. He worked as a night guard at the House of Art (Nyumba ya Sanaa), a  centre for the development of African art and craftsmanship in Dar es Salaam. Lilanga's talents were soon recognized by Jean Pruitt, an American aid worker promoting Tanzanian art. Lilanga welcomed  other artists like Robino Ntila, Augustino Malaba and Patrick Francis Imanjama to join Nyumba ya Sanaa . He also began to create paintings on batik cloth, on goatskin and on metal sheets for the finishing of railings and gates of the centre.  In 1977, he made his first journey outside Africa, travelling to New York, where he had a show at the Maryknoll Sisters Ossining Center . He stayed for a brief time in Manhattan, selling prints made on paper or cardboard, standing on street corners. Artistic development & success Shortly after beginning grammar school, Lilanga had his first contact with sculpture ( roots, softwood and, later, hard ebony), working in the Makonde tradition. He dedicated himself almost exclusively to this technique from 1961 until 1972. He showed his first works to Europeans who worked in the refugee camps during Mozambique's war of independence. Following their advice, in 1970 Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures. A lot of URLe Lilanga's lifetime art works can be found in leading international collections like The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi or the Hamburg Mawingu Collection HMC of German collector Peter-Andreas Kamphausen. Directly after the death of the artist, the HMC: URLe Lilanga Collection presented the first systematically and thematically complete catalogue of Lilanga's work. In addition, the book explores the traditional roots of East African Makonde art, as well as four decades of Lilanga's artistic development with different materials and techniques, including sculpture, paintings, etchings, drawings and metal works. Currently the HMC publish the URLe Lilanga News as an online blog with information about the artist, his art works, exhibitions and other interesting background material.

In the early years of the Mongol empire, the death of the ruling monarchs, Genghis Khan and gedei Khan, immediately stopped the Mongol western campaigns because of the upcoming elections. A drawback of the lateral succession is that, while ensuring a most competent leadership for the moment, the system inherently created derelict prince lines not eligible for succession. Any scion of an eligible heir that did not live long enough to ascend to the throne was cast aside as not eligible, creating a pool of discontented pretenders called Tegin in Turkic and Izgoi in Rus dynastic lines. The unsettled pool of derelict princes would eventually bring havoc to the succession order and dismemberment to the state.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" A drawback of the lateral succession is that, while ensuring a most competent leadership for the moment, the system inherently created derelict prince lines not eligible for succession.","after_edit":" A drawback of the lateral succession is that, while ensuring a most competent leadership for the moment, the system inherently created derelict princely lines not eligible for succession.","label":"fluency","raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"]}

{"doc_id":51488038.0,"context":"The vulture and the little girl, also known as \"The Struggling Girl\", is a famous photograph by Kevin Carter which first appeared in The New York Times on 26 March 1993. It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a hooded vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan (now South Sudan), in March 1993, and to have survived the incident. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. Carter took his own life four months after winning the prize. Background The Hunger Triangle, a name URLanisations used in the 1990s for the area defined by the southern Sudan communities Kongor, Ayod, and Waat, was dependent on UNESCO and other URLanisations to fight famine. Forty percent of the area's children under 5 years old were malnourished as of January 1993, and an estimated 10 to 13 adults died of starvation daily in Ayod alone. To raise awareness of the situation, Operation Lifeline Sudan invited photojournalists and others, previously excluded from entering the country, to report on conditions. In March 1993, the government began granting visas to journalists for a 24-hour stay with severe restrictions on their travel within the country, including government supervision at all times. Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan. It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva saw this as a chance to work more as a war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested in going. According to fellow war photographer Greg Marinovich, Carter saw the trip as an opportunity to fix some problems \"he felt trapped in\". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\". To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have \"great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan pancake\", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: \"The UN hoped to publish the famine Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for URLanisations to sustain funding\". About the political differences and fighting \"Joo and Kevin knew none of this they just wanted to get in and shoot pictures\". Waiting in Nairobi Silva and Carter had prepared carefully for the trip. They stopped in Nairobi on their way to Sudan. The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region . But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod. In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards. The residents of the hamlet have been looked after by the UN aid station for some time. Greg Marinovich and Joo Silva described that in the book The Bang Bang Club, Chapter 10 \"Flies and Hungry People\". The child was already cared for before Kevin Carter and Joo Silva landed there and Carter took his famous picture. Marinovich wrote that the villagers were already waiting next to the runway to get the food as quickly as possible: \"Mothers who had joined the throng waiting for food left their children on the sandy ground nearby.\" Silva and Carter separated to take pictures of both children and adults, both the living and dead, all victims of the catastrophic famine that had arisen through the war. Carter went several times to Silva to tell him about the shocking situation he had just photographed. Witnessing the famine affected him emotionally. Silva was searching for rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority and when he found some soldiers Carter joined him. The soldiers did not speak English, but one was interested in Carter's watch. Carter gave him his cheap wristwatch as a gift. The soldiers became their bodyguards and followed them for their protection. To stay a week with the rebels they needed the permission of a rebel commander. Their plane was due to depart in an hour and without the permission to stay they would be forced to fly out. Again they separated and Silva went to the clinic complex to ask for the rebel commander and he was told the commander was in Kongor, South Sudan. This was good news for Silva, as \"their little UN plane was heading there next\". He left the clinic and went back to the runway, taking pictures of children and adults on his way. He came across a child lying on his face in the hot sun he took a picture. In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of \"fevers\", according to his family.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards.","after_edit":" In Ayod The next day , their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards.","label":"fluency","raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"]}

The agreement was negotiated and concluded in Brussels under the auspices of the European Union and signed on 19 April 2013. Negotiations were led by Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Da\u010di\u0107 and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Tha\u00e7i and mediated by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton. The government of Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as a sovereign state, but began normalizing relations with the government of Kosovo nonetheless, in accordance with the Brussels URL In 2018, Serbia's president Aleksandar Vucic commented that the agreement is a difficult compromise for Serbia, which according to him fulfilled all of its obligations. Background Following the Kosovo War and NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Kosovo, as part of Serbia and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was placed under United Nations administration under UNSC Resolution 1244. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence and has since been recognized by 98 countries. However, Serbia maintains that Kosovo continues to be its territory. Kosovo has become a member of several international organizations, while according to Serbia and about half of the UN member states, Resolution 1244 remains legally binding on all parties.

Clinton assigned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State ambassador Philip Reeker to support Ashton's efforts. Reeker and his team coordinated closely with EU colleagues and met with Serbian and Kosovar representatives on the margins of every dialogue session in Brussels, and during visits to the region.

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered.

After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her.

{"doc_id":55503854.0,"context":"Relation to traditional epistemology Traditional epistemology and Bayesian epistemology are both forms of epistemology, but they differ in various respects, for example, concerning their methodology, the propositional attitudes they study , the role justification or confirmation plays in them and some of their research interests. Bayesian epistemology focuses on degrees of belief, also often called credences. On the other hand, Traditional epistemology focuses on knowledge, analyzed by Plato as being justified true beliefs . They then seek to understand what counts as knowledgeand how to evaluate one's beliefs (see foundationalism, coherentism, and the problem of philosophical skepticism or the question of whether knowledge is possible at all ) . Bayesian epistemology, on the other hand, works by formalizing concepts and problems, which are often vague in the traditional approach. It thereby focuses more on mathematical intuitions and promises a higher degree of precision. It sees belief as a continuous phenomenon that comes in various degrees, so-called credences. Some Bayesians have even suggested that the regular notion of belief should be abandoned. But there are also proposals to connect the two, for example, the Lockean thesis, which defines belief as credence above a certain threshold. Justification plays a central role in traditional epistemology while Bayesians have focused on the related notions of confirmation and disconfirmation through evidence. The notion of evidence is important for both approaches but only the traditional approach has been interested in studying the sources of evidence, like perception and memory. Bayesianism, on the other hand, has focused on the role of evidence for rationality: how someone's credence should be adjusted upon receiving new evidence. There is an analogy between the Bayesian norms of rationality in terms of probabilistic laws and the traditional norms of rationality in terms of deductive consistency.

It is alleged by the Pakistani government that he was arrested in the Pakistani province of Balochistan on charges of terrorism and spying for India's  Research and Analysis Wing. On 10 April 2017, India's Ministry of External Affairs stated that he had been \"kidnapped last year from Iran and his subsequent presence in Pakistan has never been explained credibly\". The Pakistani government claimed that he was a commander in the Indian Navy who was involved in subversive activities inside Pakistan and was arrested on 3 March 2016 during a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan. The Indian government recognised Jadhav as a former naval officer but denied any current links with him and maintained that he took premature retirement and operated a business in Iranian city of Chabahar and was abducted from there .Revealed: 'Spy' Kulbhushan Yadav not caught but abducted by extremist Sunni group Jaishul Adil , India Today, 30 March 2016. Pakistani security forces reported Jadhav as a serving officer in the Indian Navy and stated that he was commissioned to the Research and Analysis Wing  , India's external intelligence agency. They believed him to be involved in subversive activities in Balochistan and Karachi. Jadhav was soon shifted to Islamabad for interrogation. While according to Indian sources, Jadhav was kidnapped by Mullah Shahozi of Jaish ul-Adl from Chabahar and was transported via Sarbaz to IranPakistan border and where he handed Jadhav over to the Pakistani Army. In a statement issued in the Parliament of India on 11 April 2017, Rajnath Singh, India's Minister of Home Affairs, reiterated that Jadhav was kidnapped by Pakistani agencies from Iran and put through trial as a R AW agent. Sushma Swaraj, India's Minister of External Affairs said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Jadhav and termed his sentencing an act of \"premeditated murder\". Swaraj said that if Pakistan implemented the death sentence, the bilateral relations between both countries would face dire consequences. The ICJ proceedings began in The Hague on 15 May to review the case. India and Pakistan both sent their legal teams to put forward their arguments, led by Harish Salve and Khawar Qureshi QC respectively. On 18 May 2017, the International Court of Justice stayed the hanging of Jadhav by Pakistan . On 22 June 2017, Pakistani sources confirmed that Jadhav had sought clemency from the country's army chief following his conviction. Pakistan also released a new confessional video of Jadhav, in which he stated that he visited Karachi twice for gathering intelligence on naval facilities. He also admitted to supporting and funding, on behalf of R AW , Baloch militants affiliated with the BLA and BRA, in addition to infiltrating and establishing \"30 to 40 R AW operatives along the Makran Coast\" for involvement in terrorist activities. Jadhav said that R AW 's activities in Balochistan and Sindh were conducted under the direction of Anil Kumar Dhasmana. India's Foreign Ministry again dismissed the confession as \"false propaganda\", stating that Pakistan was trying to influence ICJ proceedings while denying the consular rights to Jadhav. ICJ did not allow Pakistan to play the video during the hearing. On 17 July 2019, the ICJ, in its verdict, rejected India's appeal for Jadhav's release and directed Pakistan to allow consular access and effectively Stayed the death sentence.

A discovery driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements: Definition of success for the plan or initiative, including a 'reverse' income statement Benchmarking against market and competitive parameters Specification of operational requirements Documentation of assumptions Specification of key checkpoints Using discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost. The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered 'real' options. A real option is a small investment made today which buys the right, but not the obligation to make further investments.McGrath, R. G. 1997.

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 123. also spelled Malecite), are an Algonquian-speaking First Nation of the Wabanaki Confederacy. They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States . Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland . Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. Wlastkw means \"Beautiful River.\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. Wlastkwewiyik means \"People of the Beautiful River,\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007. Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years. Despite devastating population losses to European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, these Atlantic First Nations held on to their traditional coastal or river locations for hunting, fishing and gathering , and were concentrated along river valleys for trapping.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages.","after_edit":" Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy  , who also still speak related Algonquian languages.","label":"others","raw_intents":["others","style","clarity"]}

On 10 April 2017, India's Ministry of External Affairs stated that he had been \"kidnapped last year from Iran and his subsequent presence in Pakistan has never been explained credibly\". The Pakistani government claimed that he was a commander in the Indian Navy who was involved in subversive activities inside Pakistan and was arrested on 3 March 2016 during a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan. The Indian government recognised Jadhav as a former naval officer but denied any current links with him and maintained that he took premature retirement and operated a business in Iranian city of Chabahar and was abducted from there .Revealed: 'Spy' Kulbhushan Yadav not caught but abducted by extremist Sunni group Jaishul Adil , India Today, 30 March 2016. Pakistani security forces reported Jadhav as a serving officer in the Indian Navy and stated that he was commissioned to the Research and Analysis Wing  , India's external intelligence agency. They believed him to be involved in subversive activities in Balochistan and Karachi. Jadhav was soon shifted to Islamabad for interrogation. While according to Indian sources, Jadhav was kidnapped by Mullah Shahozi of Jaish ul-Adl from Chabahar and was transported via Sarbaz to IranPakistan border and where he handed Jadhav over to the Pakistani Army. In a statement issued in the Parliament of India on 11 April 2017, Rajnath Singh, India's Minister of Home Affairs, reiterated that Jadhav was kidnapped by Pakistani agencies from Iran and put through trial as a R AW agent. Sushma Swaraj, India's Minister of External Affairs said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Jadhav and termed his sentencing an act of \"premeditated murder\". Swaraj said that if Pakistan implemented the death sentence, the bilateral relations between both countries would face dire consequences. The ICJ proceedings began in The Hague on 15 May to review the case. India and Pakistan both sent their legal teams to put forward their arguments, led by Harish Salve and Khawar Qureshi QC respectively. On 18 May 2017, the International Court of Justice stayed the hanging of Jadhav by Pakistan . On 22 June 2017, Pakistani sources confirmed that Jadhav had sought clemency from the country's army chief following his conviction. Pakistan also released a new confessional video of Jadhav, in which he stated that he visited Karachi twice for gathering intelligence on naval facilities. He also admitted to supporting and funding, on behalf of R AW , Baloch militants affiliated with the BLA and BRA, in addition to infiltrating and establishing \"30 to 40 R AW operatives along the Makran Coast\" for involvement in terrorist activities. Jadhav said that R AW 's activities in Balochistan and Sindh were conducted under the direction of Anil Kumar Dhasmana. India's Foreign Ministry again dismissed the confession as \"false propaganda\", stating that Pakistan was trying to influence ICJ proceedings while denying the consular rights to Jadhav. ICJ did not allow Pakistan to play the video during the hearing. On 17 July 2019, the ICJ, in its verdict, rejected India's appeal for Jadhav's release and directed Pakistan to allow consular access and effectively Stayed the death sentence. The court ordered that Pakistan should grant consular access to Jhadav. Pakistan and India both claimed victory and welcomed the judgement of ICJ.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In a statement issued in the Parliament of India on 11 April 2017, Rajnath Singh, India's Minister of Home Affairs, reiterated that Jadhav was kidnapped by Pakistani agencies from Iran and put through trial as a R AW agent.","after_edit":" In a statement issued in the Parliament of India on 11 April 2017, Rajnath Singh, India's Minister of Home Affairs, reiterated that Jadhav was kidnapped by Pakistani agencies from Iran and put through trial as a  AW agent.","label":"others","raw_intents":["others","others","others"]}

The innovator's dilemma: When new technologies cause great firms to fail. Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I. C. 1985. Milestones for successful venture planning. Harvard Business Review, 63(5): 8490 Conventional project management tools, such as stage-gate models or the use of financial tools to assess innovation  have been found to be flawed in that they are not well suited for the uncertainty of innovation-oriented projects Rajesh, S. & Zafar, I. 2008.

A discovery driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements: Definition of success for the plan or initiative, including a 'reverse' income statement Benchmarking against market and competitive parameters Specification of operational requirements Documentation of assumptions Specification of key checkpoints Using discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost. The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered 'real' options.

History 200px|Llama effigy (earthenware, slip paint) Not much is known about the Chancay civilization, which developed in the later part of the Inca Empire. This culture emerged after the fall of the Wari civilization. Parts of the southern Chancay area were conquered by the Chim in the early fifteenth century and in about 1450 A.D. the Incas were occupying both areas. It is believed that the Chancay had a centralized political structure , forming a small regional state. Thus the Chancay culture declined in the fifteenth centuryto make way for the territorial expansion of the Inca Empire . The settlements in Lauri, Lumbra, Tambo Blanco, Handrail, Pisquillo Chico and Tronconal focused mainly on artisans producing large-scale ceramics and textiles. The Chancay culture is the first of the Peruvian cultures that had mass production of ceramics, textiles and metals such as gold and silver which were ritualistic and domestic goods. They were also noted for their wood carved items. In type of fabric used include llama wool, cotton, chiffon  and feathers. Their technique involved were decorated open weave, brocade, embroidery, and painting. Brushes were used to paint anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, geometric and other creative designs directly on the canvases. The Chancay are known for the quality of their painted tapestries. The typically geometric designs also included drawings of plants, animals such as fish, cats, birds, monkeys and dogs (most notably the hairless Peruvian dog) as well as human figures. Some of the human fiber sculptures are elaborate and include such scenes as a mother teaching her daughter to weave on a backstrap loom.

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered.

After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her. In several cases, he was unable to explain why he committed the murders: this was the case with Hardy, with whom Benjamin had an intimate relationship, but after doing drugs together, he said he strangled her for no apparent reason.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991.","after_edit":"  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Tony revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991.","label":"style","raw_intents":["style","others","style"]}

Colonists therefore flew the Company's flag, to endorse the Company.

The first was to have used three solid rocket motor stages and was planned to orbit approximately 50 pounds of payload. The second used liquid rocket motors and was planned to have orbited 200 pounds of payload. Both were about long and in diameter, weighing about at launch. However, no Martlet 4 vehicles were built; the project was halted before the design was completed. Martlet 4 Control Systems A guidance and control system was developed for the orbital mission by Aviation Electric Limited of Montreal under the direction of McGill-BRL-Harry Diamond Laboratory group. Infrared horizon sensors and sun sensors were included to calculate vehicle attitude. Information for on-board sensors was to be processed by the logic module  which provided commands to a cold gas thruster system which in turn adjusted the orientation of the vehicle . The components of the guidance and control assembly were integrated into a 6.25 inch diameter test projectile. Sun sensors, horizon sensors, telemetry packs, receiving\/transmitting antenna, hydraulic systems, logic modules, and gas thruster attitude control systems were all test fired to approximately 10,000 g's.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Infrared horizon sensors and sun sensors were included to calculate vehicle attitude.","after_edit":" Infrared horizon sensors and sun sensors were included in calculating vehicle attitude.","label":"style","raw_intents":["style","clarity","style"]}
{"doc_id":8556500.0,"context":"Oil pulling is an alternative medical practice in which an edible oil is swished around the mouth for a period of time and then spat out, similar to mouthwash. There is only limited and inconclusive evidence to support the claims made for the benefits of oil pulling. Some practitioners of oil pulling claim it is capable of improving oral and whole-body health, including a benefit in conditions such as headaches, migraines, diabetes mellitus, asthma, and acne, as well as whitening teeth. Some of its promoters claim it works by pulling out toxins, which are known as ama in Ayurveda, . There is no credible evidence to support the claims about toxins. There is only limited and inconclusive evidence to support others of these claims, primarily having to do with oral health. The scientific case for oil pulling for oral health rests on multiple studies that have found that oil pulling, particularly with coconut oil, reduces bacteria and inflammation in the mouth. A review of the evidence published in the scientific journal Heliyon (august 7, 2020) URL found \"The limited evidence suggests that oil pulling with coconut oil may have a beneficial effect on improving oral health and dental hygiene. Future clinical trials are of merit considering the universal availability of the intervention. Prospective research should have a robust design with rigorous execution to provide a higher quality of evidence... Oil pulling with coconut oil could be used as a adjunct to normal preventative regimes to improve oral health and dental hygiene although further studies are needed to determine the level of effectiveness.\" This article was deemed significant enought for the toothpaste maker Colgate to cite it on its website URL","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Some of its promoters claim it works by pulling out toxins, which are known as ama in Ayurveda, .","after_edit":" Its promoters claim it works by pulling out toxins, which are known as ama in Ayurveda, .","label":"style","raw_intents":["style","clarity","style"]}
{"doc_id":18309949.0,"context":"A discordant system or pattern does not correlate to the topography and geology of the area. Discordant drainage patterns are classified into two main types: antecedent and superimposed, while anteposition drainage patterns combine the two. In antecedent drainage, a river's vertical incision ability matches that of land uplift due to tectonic forces. Superimposed drainage develops differently: initially, a drainage system develops on a surface composed of 'younger' rocks, but due to denudative activities this surface of younger rocks is removed and the river continues to flow over a seemingly new surface, but one in fact made up of rocks of old geological formation. Dendritic drainage patterns Dendritic drainage pattern Dendritic drainage systems (from Greek , dendrites, \"of or like a tree\") are not straight and are the most common form of  drainage system. In this, there are many sub-tributaries (analogous to the twigs of a tree), which merge into tributaries of the main river (the branches and the trunk of the tree, respectively). They are seen to feed a river channel that matches and is strongly accordant to the overriding gradient of the land. Truly dendritic systems form in V-shaped valleys; as a result, the rock types must be quite  impervious and non-porous. Trellis drainage pattern The geometry of a trellis drainage system is similar to that of a common garden trellis. Along a strike valley, smaller tributaries feed into from the steep slopes of mountain sides . These tributaries enter the main river about perpendicular, causing a trellis-like appearance of the system. They form where hard and soft formations exist on both banks of the main river, and are reflective of height, accentuated by erosion. Trellis drainage is characteristic of folded mountains, such as the Appalachian Mountains in North America and in the north part of Trinidad.Ritter, Michael E., The Physical Environment: an Introduction to Physical Geography. 2006 Rectangular drainage pattern Rectangular drainage develops on rocks that are of approximately uniform resistance to erosion, but which have two directions of jointing at approximately right angles or 90 degrees. The joints are usually less resistant to erosion than the bulk rock so erosion tends to preferentially open the joints and streams eventually develop along the joints. The result is a stream system in which streams consist mainly of straight line segments with right angle bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles. This pattern can be found with the Arun River in Nepal.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" as a result, the rock types must be quite  impervious and non-porous.","after_edit":" as a result, the rock types must be quite obviously impervious and non-porous.","label":"style","raw_intents":["style","meaning-changed","style"]}
