However, when applied to zero-shot cross-lingual transfer tasks, most existing methods use only single-language input for LM finetuning, without leveraging the intrinsic cross-lingual alignment between different languages that is essential for multilingual tasks. In this paper, we propose FILTER, an enhanced fusion method that takes cross-lingual data as input for XLM finetuning. Specifically, FILTER first encodes text input in the source language and its translation in the target language independently in the shallow layers, then performs cross-lingual fusion to extract multilingual knowledge in the intermediate layers, and finally performs further language-specific encoding. During inference, the model makes predictions based on the text input in the target language and its translation in the source language. For simple tasks such as classification, translated text in the target language shares the same label as the source language. However, this shared label becomes less accurate or even unavailable for more complex tasks such as question answering, NER and POS tagging. For better model scalability , we further propose an additional KL-divergence self-teaching loss for model training, based on auto-generated soft pseudo-labels for translated text in the target language.

This paper deals with sarcasm detection on reddit comments. Several machine learning and deep learning algorithms have been applied for the same but each of these models only take into account the initial text instead of the conversation which serves as a better measure to determine sarcasm .

Johnson, 38, of Kingsford, Michigan was charged on Wednesday with killing three teenagers in a shooting on the Menominee River near Niagara, Wisconsin. Johnson was charged with first-degree intentional homicide. Authorities say he went to the popular bathing spot near the East Kingsford Railroad Bridge on July 31 and opened fire with a military-style rifle, killing three and injuring one. The Associated Press reports that he faces life in prison without parole if convicted . Wisconsin does not have the death penalty. However, as one of the bodies was found on the Michigan side of the border, he could potentially face charges there, or perhaps even in federal court. He is being represented by a public defender, Len Kachinsky. Local teens said Johnson often was seen at the site, but mostly kept to himself. On July 31, the Associated Press reports  he emerged from the woods wearing camouflage clothing and opened fire without saying a word. Johnson fled and surrendered the next day after a multi-agency manhunt. Johnson had been accused of a sexual assault, and his mother speculated he may have panicked after hearing police wanted to speak with him. The Detroit Free Press reports that  in a confession to police, Johnson said the shooting was set in motion when Johnson lured the woman to the bridge the day before and sexually assaulted her. Worried that he would be arrested, Johnson returned to the woods, planning to ambush law enforcement officers coming to find him. After he spent a night in the woods and no officers came, he returned home at 10 a.m.  on July 31, asked his mother if police had been looking for him, then left at 3:00 p.m. He says he then got his weapons and returned to the woods. Johnson said he planned to wait for the teens to reach the Michigan side of the river so he could kill them all and use them as \"bait\" to lure police into his ambush. However, Spigarelli and Pohlson unexpectedly approached his position, and he said he felt trapped and he opened fire. Spigarelli and Pohlson were both shot in the head and died instantly. Johnson then reloaded and fired across the river, killing Bryan Mort.","domain":"news","before_edit":" After he spent a night in the woods and no officers came, he returned home at 10 a.m.  on July 31, asked his mother if police had been looking for him, then left at 3:00 p.m.","after_edit":" After he spent a night in the woods and no officers came, he returned home at 10 a.m. local time on July 31, asked his mother if police had been looking for him, then left at 3:00 p.m.","label":"meaning-changed","raw_intents":["meaning-changed","meaning-changed","meaning-changed"]}

{"doc_id":55503854.0,"context":"Relation to traditional epistemology Traditional epistemology and Bayesian epistemology are both forms of epistemology, but they differ in various respects, for example, concerning their methodology, their interpretation of belief , the role justification or confirmation plays in them and some of their research interests. Traditional epistemology focuses on topics such as the analysis of the nature of knowledge, usually in terms of justified true beliefs , the sources of knowledge , like perception or testimony, the structure of a body of knowledge, for example in the form of foundationalismor coherentism, and the problem of philosophical skepticism or the question of whether knowledge is possible at all . These inquiries are usually based on epistemic intuitions and regard beliefs as either present or absent . Bayesian epistemology, on the other hand, works by formalizing concepts and problems, which are often vague in the traditional approach. It thereby focuses more on mathematical intuitions and promises a higher degree of precision. It sees belief as a continuous phenomenon that comes in various degrees, so-called credences. Some Bayesians have even suggested that the regular notion of belief should be abandoned. But there are also proposals to connect the two, for example, the Lockean thesis, which defines belief as credence above a certain threshold. Justification plays a central role in traditional epistemology while Bayesians have focused on the related notions of confirmation and disconfirmation through evidence. The notion of evidence is important for both approaches but only the traditional approach has been interested in studying the sources of evidence, like perception and memory. Bayesianism, on the other hand, has focused on the role of evidence for rationality: how someone's credence should be adjusted upon receiving new evidence. There is an analogy between the Bayesian norms of rationality in terms of probabilistic laws and the traditional norms of rationality in terms of deductive consistency. Certain traditional problems, like the topic of skepticism about our knowledge of the external world, are difficult to express in Bayesian terms.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Traditional epistemology focuses on topics such as the analysis of the nature of knowledge, usually in terms of justified true beliefs , the sources of knowledge , like perception or testimony, the structure of a body of knowledge, for example in the form of foundationalismor coherentism, and the problem of philosophical skepticism or the question of whether knowledge is possible at all .","after_edit":" Traditional epistemology focuses on topics such as the analysis of the nature of knowledge, usually in terms of justified true beliefs .

The agreement was negotiated and concluded in Brussels under the auspices of the European Union and signed on 19 April 2013. Negotiations were led by Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dai and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thai and mediated by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton. The government of Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as a sovereign state, but began normalizing relations with the government of Kosovo nonetheless, in accordance with the Brussels URL Background Following the Kosovo War and NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Kosovo, as part of Serbia and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was placed under United Nations administration under UNSC Resolution 1244. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence and has since been recognized by 96 countries. However, Serbia maintains that Kosovo continues to be its territory. Kosovo has become a member of several URLanizations, while according to Serbia and about half of the UN member states, Resolution 1244 remains legally binding on all parties. The EU-mediated dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia was launched in March 2011, three years after Kosovo declared URL Belgrade and Pristina were urged to continue talks in Brussels, but Serbia was not obliged to recognize Kosovo at any point in the URL Talks Until preset, ten rounds of talks have been held at the European External Action Service office in Brussels. Baroness Ashton, the EU High Representative, had been chairing talks for two years, followed by Federica Mogherini. Normalization of relations with neighboring states is a key precondition for states wishing to join the EU; the Brussels Agreement brought Serbia close to EU accession talks and Kosovo to initialing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). The SAA was signed by HR Mogherini and PM Mustafa in October 2015. Removing the parallel Serbian structures in the Northern part of Kosovo remains challenging. 330px|Ivica Dai, Prime Minister of Serbia (left), Catherine Ashton (middle), and Hashim Thai, Prime Minister of Kosovo (right) in Munich, 2014. United States diplomats have supported the EU-led dialogue from the beginning. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton invited Baroness Ashton to undertake joint travel in the Balkans, and the two made joint visits to Belgrade and Pristina (as well as Sarajevo) in October 2012. Clinton assigned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State ambassador Philip Reeker to support Ashton's efforts. Reeker and his team coordinated closely with EU colleagues and met with Serbian and Kosovar representatives on the margins of every dialogue session in Brussels, and during visits to the region. The result was the 15-point \"First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalisation of Relations\", initialed but not signed on 19 April 2013. After the agreement was concluded, the European Commission officially advised that work start on an SAA with Kosovo, and accession negotiations began with Serbia. The agreement was supported by the European Union, NATO, the OSCE, and the United Nations. In October 2013, arrangements were made for Serbian officials to visit North Kosovo. It was agreed that electoral bodies in Kosovo would include Kosovo Serb representatives and that international dialing code +383 would be attributed to Kosovo. The new code was expected to go into effect in late 2015 but has again been delayed by Serbia until March 2016. The geographic phone code was implemented in December 2016.

{"doc_id":250641.0,"context":"The role of the librarian has changed much over time, with the past century in particular bringing many new media and technologies into play. From the earliest libraries in the ancient world to the modern information hub, there have been keepers and disseminators of the information held in data stores. Roles and responsibilities vary widely depending on the type of library and specialist librarian, from academic libraries to public libraries, as well as the functions needed behind the scenes to maintain the collection and make it available to its users. The Great Library of Alexandria, created by Ptolemy I after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, was created to house the entirety of Greek literature. It was notable for its famous librarians: Demetrius, Zenodotus, Eratosthenes, Apollonius, Aristophanes, Aristarchus, and Callimachus. These scholars contributed significantly to the collection and cataloging of the wide variety of scrolls in the library's collection. Most notably, Callimachus created what is considered to be the first subject catalogue of the library holdings, called the pinakes. The pinakes contained 120 scrolls arranged into ten subject classes; each class was then subdivided, listing authors alphabetically by titles. The librarians at Alexandria were considered the \"custodians of learning\". As the crisis escalated,  was a high demand for contact tracers, and the CDC had earlier named librarians as key public health staff to support COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing, so many librarians and library staff volunteered to help with contact tracing. Librarians also supported their community in other ways  such as staffing non-emergency hotlines and manning shelters for the homeless, for which they were able to retain their income, while others were furloughed for a time. Additional responsibilities Experienced librarians may take administrative positions such as library or information center director or learning resource officer. Similar to the management of any URLanization, they are concerned with the long-term planning of the library, and its relationship with its URLanization (the city or county for a public library, the college\/university for an academic library, or URLanization served by a special library). In smaller or specialized libraries, librarians typically perform a wide range of the different duties. upJustin Winsor, Librarian of Congress, c. 1885 Representative examples of librarian responsibilities: Researching topics of interest for their constituencies. Referring patrons to other URLanizations and government offices. Suggesting appropriate books (\"readers' advisory\") for children of different reading levels, and recommending novels for recreational reading. Reviewing books and journal databases Working with other URLanisations to establish continual, lifelong learning and further education initiatives Facilitating and promoting reading clubs. Developing programs for library users of all ages and backgrounds. Managing access to electronic information resources. Assessing library services and collections in order to best meet library users' needs. Building and maintaining collections to respond to changing community needs or demands Creating pathfinders Writing grants to gain funding for expanded program or collections Digitizing collections for online access Publishing articles in library science journals Answering incoming reference questions via telephone, postal mail, email, fax, and chat delivering arts and cultural activities to local communities Initiating and establishing creative digital activities to introduce children to coding, engineering and website building Marking promotion and advocacy of library services Assisting job seekers and local businesses Making and enforcing computer appointments on the public access Internet computers.\"The librarian's Internet survival guide: strategies for the high-tech reference desk\", Irene E.

They can be highly specialized, serving a discrete user group with a restricted collection area. In an increasingly global and virtual workplace, many special librarians may not even work in a library at all but instead manage and facilitate the use of electronic collections.

The innovator's dilemma: When new technologies cause great firms to fail. Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I. C. 1985. Milestones for successful venture planning.

A discovery driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements: Definition of success for the plan or initiative, including a 'reverse' income statement Benchmarking against market and competitive parameters Specification of operational requirements Documentation of assumptions Specification of key checkpoints Using discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost. The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered 'real' options.

In 1971, he found his first employment, thanks to his uncle, Augustino Malaba, an already well-known sculptor, who would be his future collaborator. He worked as a night guard at the House of Art (Nyumba ya Sanaa), a  centre for the development of African art and craftsmanship in Dar es Salaam. Lilanga's talents were soon recognized by Jean Pruitt, an American aid worker promoting Tanzanian art. Lilanga welcomed  other artists like Robino Ntila, Augustino Malaba and Patrick Francis Imanjama to join Nyumba ya Sanaa . He also began to create paintings on batik cloth, on goatskin and on metal sheets for the finishing of railings and gates of the centre.  In 1977, he made his first journey outside Africa, travelling to New York, where he had a show at the Maryknoll Sisters Ossining Center . He stayed for a brief time in Manhattan, selling prints made on paper or cardboard, standing on street corners. Artistic development & success Shortly after beginning grammar school, Lilanga had his first contact with sculpture ( roots, softwood and, later, hard ebony), working in the Makonde tradition. He dedicated himself almost exclusively to this technique from 1961 until 1972. He showed his first works to Europeans who worked in the refugee camps during Mozambique's war of independence. Following their advice, in 1970 Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures. A lot of URLe Lilanga's lifetime art works can be found in leading international collections like The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi or the Hamburg Mawingu Collection HMC of German collector Peter-Andreas Kamphausen. Directly after the death of the artist, the HMC: URLe Lilanga Collection presented the first systematically and thematically complete catalogue of Lilanga's work. In addition, the book explores the traditional roots of East African Makonde art, as well as four decades of Lilanga's artistic development with different materials and techniques, including sculpture, paintings, etchings, drawings and metal works. Currently the HMC publish the URLe Lilanga News as an online blog with information about the artist, his art works, exhibitions and other interesting background material.

The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States .

Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years.

His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered.

After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day.

Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991.

{"doc_id":55503854.0,"context":"Relation to traditional epistemology Traditional epistemology and Bayesian epistemology are both forms of epistemology, but they differ in various respects, for example, concerning their methodology, the propositional attitudes they study , the role justification or confirmation plays in them and some of their research interests. Bayesian epistemology focuses on degrees of belief, also often called credences. On the other hand, Traditional epistemology focuses on knowledge, analyzed by Plato as being justified true beliefs . They then seek to understand what counts as knowledgeand how to evaluate one's beliefs (see foundationalism, coherentism, and the problem of philosophical skepticism or the question of whether knowledge is possible at all ) . Bayesian epistemology, on the other hand, works by formalizing concepts and problems, which are often vague in the traditional approach. It thereby focuses more on mathematical intuitions and promises a higher degree of precision. It sees belief as a continuous phenomenon that comes in various degrees, so-called credences. Some Bayesians have even suggested that the regular notion of belief should be abandoned. But there are also proposals to connect the two, for example, the Lockean thesis, which defines belief as credence above a certain threshold. Justification plays a central role in traditional epistemology while Bayesians have focused on the related notions of confirmation and disconfirmation through evidence. The notion of evidence is important for both approaches but only the traditional approach has been interested in studying the sources of evidence, like perception and memory. Bayesianism, on the other hand, has focused on the role of evidence for rationality: how someone's credence should be adjusted upon receiving new evidence. There is an analogy between the Bayesian norms of rationality in terms of probabilistic laws and the traditional norms of rationality in terms of deductive consistency. Certain traditional problems, like the topic of skepticism about our knowledge of the external world, are difficult to express in Bayesian terms.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" On the other hand, Traditional epistemology focuses on knowledge, analyzed by Plato as being justified true beliefs .

Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I.

A discovery driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements: Definition of success for the plan or initiative, including a 'reverse' income statement Benchmarking against market and competitive parameters Specification of operational requirements Documentation of assumptions Specification of key checkpoints Using discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost. The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered 'real' options.

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 123. also spelled Malecite), are an Algonquian-speaking First Nation of the Wabanaki Confederacy. They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States . Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland . Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. Wlastkw means \"Beautiful River.\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. Wlastkwewiyik means \"People of the Beautiful River,\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007. Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years. Despite devastating population losses to European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, these Atlantic First Nations held on to their traditional coastal or river locations for hunting, fishing and gathering , and were concentrated along river valleys for trapping.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages.","after_edit":" Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy  , who also still speak related Algonquian languages.","label":"others","raw_intents":["others","style","clarity"]}

By taking a sextant reading within 15 to 30 minutes prior to local noon ( zenith ) and noting the time, then leaving the sextant set to the same angle and subsequently observing the moment in time at which the sun passes through the sight tube on its descent from Zenith between a half-hour and hour later, the two times can be averaged to obtain a longitude sufficiently accurate for navigation (within 2nmi).American Practical Navigator (bowditch) by Nathanial Bowditch p253","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" However, it is possible to determine the time of zenith for longitude with a useful accuracy by performing a mean time of observation when the sun is on its ascent and descent prior to and following its moment of Zenith .","after_edit":" However, it is possible to determine the time of culmination for longitude with a useful accuracy by performing a mean time of observation when the sun is on its ascent and descent prior to and following its moment of Zenith .","label":"style","raw_intents":["style","others","clarity"]}

{"doc_id":38569161.0,"context":"170px|Textile doll (cotton, wool, wood) The Chancay were a pre-Columbian archeological civilization which developed between the valleys of Fortaleza, Pativilca, Supe, Huaura, Chancay, Chilln, Rimac and Lurn, on the central coast of Peru, from about CE 1000 to 1470. History 200px|Llama effigy (earthenware, slip paint) Not much is known about the Chancay civilization, which developed in the later part of the Inca Empire. This culture emerged after the fall of the Wari civilization. Parts of the southern Chancay area were conquered by the Chim in the early fifteenth century and in about 1450 A.D. the Incas were occupying both areas. It is believed that the Chancay had a centralized political structure , forming a small regional state. Thus the Chancay culture declined in the fifteenth centuryto make way for the territorial expansion of the Inca Empire . The settlements in Lauri, Lumbra, Tambo Blanco, Handrail, Pisquillo Chico and Tronconal focused mainly on artisans producing large-scale ceramics and textiles. The Chancay culture is the first of the Peruvian cultures that had mass production of ceramics, textiles and metals such as gold and silver which were ritualistic and domestic goods. They were also noted for their wood carved items. In type of fabric used include llama wool, cotton, chiffon  and feathers. Their technique involved were decorated open weave, brocade, embroidery, and painting. Brushes were used to paint anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, geometric and other creative designs directly on the canvases. The Chancay are known for the quality of their painted tapestries. The typically geometric designs also included drawings of plants, animals such as fish, cats, birds, monkeys and dogs (most notably the hairless Peruvian dog) as well as human figures. Some of the human fiber sculptures are elaborate and include such scenes as a mother teaching her daughter to weave on a backstrap loom. Birds and deities wearing crescent-like headdresses were one of the more common decorative features. They produced a variety of goods such as clothing, bags, and funeral masks.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" It is believed that the Chancay had a centralized political structure , forming a small regional state.","after_edit":" The Chancay likely had a centralized political structure , forming a small regional state.","label":"style","raw_intents":["style","style","clarity"]}
