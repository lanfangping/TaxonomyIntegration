It is alleged by the Pakistani government that he was arrested in the Pakistani province of Balochistan on charges of terrorism and spying for India's  Research and Analysis Wing. On 10 April 2017, India's Ministry of External Affairs stated that he had been \"kidnapped last year from Iran and his subsequent presence in Pakistan has never been explained credibly\". The Pakistani government claimed that he was a commander in the Indian Navy who was involved in subversive activities inside Pakistan and was arrested on 3 March 2016 during a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan. The Indian government recognised Jadhav as a former naval officer but denied any current links with him and maintained that he took premature retirement and operated a business in Iranian city of Chabahar and was abducted from there .Revealed: 'Spy' Kulbhushan Yadav not caught but abducted by extremist Sunni group Jaishul Adil , India Today, 30 March 2016. Pakistani security forces reported Jadhav as a serving officer in the Indian Navy and stated that he was commissioned to the Research and Analysis Wing  , India's external intelligence agency. They believed him to be involved in subversive activities in Balochistan and Karachi. Jadhav was soon shifted to Islamabad for interrogation. While according to Indian sources, Jadhav was kidnapped by Mullah Shahozi of Jaish ul-Adl from Chabahar and was transported via Sarbaz to IranPakistan border and where he handed Jadhav over to the Pakistani Army. In a statement issued in the Parliament of India on 11 April 2017, Rajnath Singh, India's Minister of Home Affairs, reiterated that Jadhav was kidnapped by Pakistani agencies from Iran and put through trial as a R AW agent. Sushma Swaraj, India's Minister of External Affairs said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Jadhav and termed his sentencing an act of \"premeditated murder\". Swaraj said that if Pakistan implemented the death sentence, the bilateral relations between both countries would face dire consequences. The ICJ proceedings began in The Hague on 15 May to review the case. India and Pakistan both sent their legal teams to put forward their arguments, led by Harish Salve and Khawar Qureshi QC respectively. On 18 May 2017, the International Court of Justice stayed the hanging of Jadhav by Pakistan . On 22 June 2017, Pakistani sources confirmed that Jadhav had sought clemency from the country's army chief following his conviction. Pakistan also released a new confessional video of Jadhav, in which he stated that he visited Karachi twice for gathering intelligence on naval facilities. He also admitted to supporting and funding, on behalf of R AW , Baloch militants affiliated with the BLA and BRA, in addition to infiltrating and establishing \"30 to 40 R AW operatives along the Makran Coast\" for involvement in terrorist activities. Jadhav said that R AW 's activities in Balochistan and Sindh were conducted under the direction of Anil Kumar Dhasmana. India's Foreign Ministry again dismissed the confession as \"false propaganda\", stating that Pakistan was trying to influence ICJ proceedings while denying the consular rights to Jadhav. ICJ did not allow Pakistan to play the video during the hearing. On 17 July 2019, the ICJ, in its verdict, rejected India's appeal for Jadhav's release and directed Pakistan to allow consular access and effectively Stayed the death sentence.

{"doc_id":1556660.0,"context":"Gray death is a slang term used for a potent mixture of synthetic opioids. Samples have been found to contain the designer drug U-47700, heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil . It is taken by injection, smoking, snorting, or oral ingestion. It was first discovered in the United States and was thought to be a unique chemical compound before being identified as a mixture of drugs. In addition to containing powerful opioids, what makes gray death an extremely dangerous drug is the fact that the constituent drugs' identities, their overall ratios in the product, and their uneven distribution within the productare completely unknown to the user. This means that the user cannot predict what dose to safely take; even two identical doses by mass may contain more or less of an unknown substance due to uneven physical distribution, as seen with heroin and fentanyl mixes. Opioid addicts tend to be more susceptible to the drug . They may think they are buying heroin, unaware that it is actually gray death. Reversing a gray death overdose frequently requires multiple doses of naloxone , whereas a typical overdose of heroin (which is much less potent) typically needs only one dose. This is consistent with the difficulty of overdose reversal seen with high-affinity opioids in the fentanyl chemical family or with buprenorphine. The greater affinity of these substances for the -opioid receptor causes less naloxoneto bind to receptors, increasing the dosage necessary to counteract the resulting respiratory depression. The difficulty in reversing an overdose of gray death is likely due to the presence of a fentanyl analogue, which reporting seems to corroborate as of December 2018.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Samples have been found to contain the designer drug U-47700, heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil .","after_edit":" Samples have been found to contain  heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil .","label":"coherence","raw_intents":["coherence","coherence","clarity"]}

The period saw Singapore establish itself as an important trading port and developed into a major city with a rapid increase in population. British rule was suspended in February 1942, when the Imperial Japanese Army of the Japanese Empire had invaded Singapore during the Pacific Front of World War II and renamed it Syonan-to . After the war, Singapore was returned to British rule. It subsequently separated from the Straits Settlements itself, and became its own standalone crown colony with its own governor. Beginning of British rule in Singapore An 1888 German map of Singapore. In 1819, British official Stamford Raffles landed in Singapore to establish a trading port. The island's status as a British outpost was initially in doubt, as the Dutch government soon issued bitter protests to the British government, arguing that their sphere of influence had been violated. The British government and the East India Company were initially worried about the potential liability of this new outpost, but that was soon overshadowed by Singapore's rapid growth as an important trading post. By 1822, it was made clear to the Dutch that the British had no intention of giving up the island.

They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States .

Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years. Despite devastating population losses to European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, these Atlantic First Nations held on to their traditional coastal or river locations for hunting, fishing and gathering , and were concentrated along river valleys for trapping.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States .","after_edit":" The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America .

It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a hooded vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan (now South Sudan), in March 1993, and to have survived the incident. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. Carter took his own life four months after winning the prize. Background The Hunger Triangle, a name URLanisations used in the 1990s for the area defined by the southern Sudan communities Kongor, Ayod, and Waat, was dependent on UNESCO and other URLanisations to fight famine. Forty percent of the area's children under 5 years old were malnourished as of January 1993, and an estimated 10 to 13 adults died of starvation daily in Ayod alone. To raise awareness of the situation, Operation Lifeline Sudan invited photojournalists and others, previously excluded from entering the country, to report on conditions. In March 1993, the government began granting visas to journalists for a 24-hour stay with severe restrictions on their travel within the country, including government supervision at all times. Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan. It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva saw this as a chance to work more as a war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested in going. According to fellow war photographer Greg Marinovich, Carter saw the trip as an opportunity to fix some problems \"he felt trapped in\". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\". To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have \"great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan pancake\", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: \"The UN hoped to publish the famine Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for URLanisations to sustain funding\". About the political differences and fighting \"Joo and Kevin knew none of this they just wanted to get in and shoot pictures\". Waiting in Nairobi Silva and Carter had prepared carefully for the trip. They stopped in Nairobi on their way to Sudan. The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region . But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod. In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards. The residents of the hamlet have been looked after by the UN aid station for some time. Greg Marinovich and Joo Silva described that in the book The Bang Bang Club, Chapter 10 \"Flies and Hungry People\". The child was already cared for before Kevin Carter and Joo Silva landed there and Carter took his famous picture. Marinovich wrote that the villagers were already waiting next to the runway to get the food as quickly as possible: \"Mothers who had joined the throng waiting for food left their children on the sandy ground nearby.\" Silva and Carter separated to take pictures of both children and adults, both the living and dead, all victims of the catastrophic famine that had arisen through the war. Carter went several times to Silva to tell him about the shocking situation he had just photographed. Witnessing the famine affected him emotionally. Silva was searching for rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority and when he found some soldiers Carter joined him. The soldiers did not speak English, but one was interested in Carter's watch. Carter gave him his cheap wristwatch as a gift. The soldiers became their bodyguards and followed them for their protection. To stay a week with the rebels they needed the permission of a rebel commander. Their plane was due to depart in an hour and without the permission to stay they would be forced to fly out. Again they separated and Silva went to the clinic complex to ask for the rebel commander and he was told the commander was in Kongor, South Sudan. This was good news for Silva, as \"their little UN plane was heading there next\". He left the clinic and went back to the runway, taking pictures of children and adults on his way. He came across a child lying on his face in the hot sun he took a picture. In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of \"fevers\", according to his family.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards.","after_edit":" In Ayod The next day , their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards.","label":"fluency","raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"]}
{"doc_id":6970425.0,"context":"Lateral succession Lateral or fraternal system of succession mandates principles of seniority among members of a dynasty or dynastic clan, with a purpose of election a best qualified candidate for the leadership. The leaders are elected as being the most mature elders of the clan, already in possession of military power and competence. Fraternal succession is preferred to ensure that mature leaders are in charge, removing a need for regents. The lateral system of succession may or may not exclude male descendants in the female line from succession. In practice, when no male heir is mature enough, a female heir is usually determined \"pragmatically\", by proximity to the last monarch, like Boariks of the Caucasian Huns or Tamiris of Massagetes in Middle Asia  . The lateral monarch is generally elected after the leadership throne becomes vacant. In the early years of the Mongol empire, the death of the ruling monarchs, Genghis Khan and gedei Khan, immediately stopped the Mongol western campaigns because of the upcoming elections. A drawback of the lateral succession is that, while ensuring a most competent leadership for the moment, the system inherently created derelict prince lines not eligible for succession. Any scion of an eligible heir that did not live long enough to ascend to the throne was cast aside as not eligible, creating a pool of discontented pretenders called Tegin in Turkic and Izgoi in Rus dynastic lines. The unsettled pool of derelict princes would eventually bring havoc to the succession order and dismemberment to the state.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" A drawback of the lateral succession is that, while ensuring a most competent leadership for the moment, the system inherently created derelict prince lines not eligible for succession.","after_edit":" A drawback of the lateral succession is that, while ensuring a most competent leadership for the moment, the system inherently created derelict princely lines not eligible for succession.","label":"fluency","raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"]}

The casings survived , but the propellant failed at . This was solved for later rockets by filling the propellant cavity with liquid, but only after development of the 3B model had ended. Martlet 3E The Martlet 3E was a suborbital solid rocket designed to be fired from a smaller, 7-inch (180mm) cannon used in the HARP project. Its basic concept revolved around packaging the rocket grain in a case with elastic properties to transmit the lateral strain to the gun tube. The 3E model utilized a new technique of rocket grain construction  that consisted of laminating sheet double-base propellant grain under hydraulic pressure. Martlet 4 By July 1964, the Marlet 4 program pursued the development of an orbit capable multi-stage rocket system to be launched from the 16\" Barbados gun. Two versions of full-scale orbital launch vehicle projectiles were proposed in the Martlet 4 series. The first was to have used three solid rocket motor stages and was planned to orbit approximately 50 pounds of payload. The second used liquid rocket motors and was planned to have orbited 200 pounds of payload. Both were about long and in diameter, weighing about at launch. However, no Martlet 4 vehicles were built; the project was halted before the design was completed. Martlet 4 Control Systems A guidance and control system was developed for the orbital mission by Aviation Electric Limited of Montreal under the direction of McGill-BRL-Harry Diamond Laboratory group. Infrared horizon sensors and sun sensors were included to calculate vehicle attitude. Information for on-board sensors was to be processed by the logic module  which provided commands to a cold gas thruster system which in turn adjusted the orientation of the vehicle .

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 123. also spelled Malecite), are an Algonquian-speaking First Nation of the Wabanaki Confederacy. They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States . Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland . Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. Wlastkw means \"Beautiful River.\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. Wlastkwewiyik means \"People of the Beautiful River,\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007. Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years. Despite devastating population losses to European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, these Atlantic First Nations held on to their traditional coastal or river locations for hunting, fishing and gathering , and were concentrated along river valleys for trapping.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own.","after_edit":" Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently , by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own.","label":"fluency","raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"]}

On 10 April 2017, India's Ministry of External Affairs stated that he had been \"kidnapped last year from Iran and his subsequent presence in Pakistan has never been explained credibly\".

Pakistani security forces reported Jadhav as a serving officer in the Indian Navy and stated that he was commissioned to the Research and Analysis Wing  , India's external intelligence agency. They believed him to be involved in subversive activities in Balochistan and Karachi. Jadhav was soon shifted to Islamabad for interrogation. While according to Indian sources, Jadhav was kidnapped by Mullah Shahozi of Jaish ul-Adl from Chabahar and was transported via Sarbaz to IranPakistan border and where he handed Jadhav over to the Pakistani Army. In a statement issued in the Parliament of India on 11 April 2017, Rajnath Singh, India's Minister of Home Affairs, reiterated that Jadhav was kidnapped by Pakistani agencies from Iran and put through trial as a R AW agent. Sushma Swaraj, India's Minister of External Affairs said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Jadhav and termed his sentencing an act of \"premeditated murder\". Swaraj said that if Pakistan implemented the death sentence, the bilateral relations between both countries would face dire consequences. The ICJ proceedings began in The Hague on 15 May to review the case. India and Pakistan both sent their legal teams to put forward their arguments, led by Harish Salve and Khawar Qureshi QC respectively. On 18 May 2017, the International Court of Justice stayed the hanging of Jadhav by Pakistan . On 22 June 2017, Pakistani sources confirmed that Jadhav had sought clemency from the country's army chief following his conviction. Pakistan also released a new confessional video of Jadhav, in which he stated that he visited Karachi twice for gathering intelligence on naval facilities. He also admitted to supporting and funding, on behalf of R AW , Baloch militants affiliated with the BLA and BRA, in addition to infiltrating and establishing \"30 to 40 R AW operatives along the Makran Coast\" for involvement in terrorist activities. Jadhav said that R AW 's activities in Balochistan and Sindh were conducted under the direction of Anil Kumar Dhasmana. India's Foreign Ministry again dismissed the confession as \"false propaganda\", stating that Pakistan was trying to influence ICJ proceedings while denying the consular rights to Jadhav. ICJ did not allow Pakistan to play the video during the hearing. On 17 July 2019, the ICJ, in its verdict, rejected India's appeal for Jadhav's release and directed Pakistan to allow consular access and effectively Stayed the death sentence.

Deva king Indra made a weapon named the Vajra using the skeleton of Dadhichi, which he used in his battle against his enemies, the Asuras. In this battle 99 heroes in the army of the Daityas, (a clan of Asuras) were slain. After this great war there was a drought extending for 12 years. During that drought extending for twelve years, the great sages (who practiced Vedic traditions and who were settled on the banks of Saraswati River) for the sake of sustenance, migrated from the river valley (9:51). However, Sage Saraswata continued to live on the banks of the Saraswati. After the drought of 12 years had died, the great sages solicited one another for lectures on the Vedas. While wandering with famished stomachs, the sages had lost the knowledge of the Vedas. There was, indeed, not one amongst them that could understand the scriptures. It chanced that someone amongst them encountered Saraswata, that foremost of sages, while the latter was reading the Vedas with concentrated attention. Coming back to the conclave of rishis, he spoke to them of Saraswata, of unrivalled splendour and god-like form engaged in reading the Vedas in a solitary forest. Then all the great Rishis came to that spot, and jointly asked him to teach them the Vedas. Those sages duly became his disciples and obtaining from him their knowledge of the Vedas, once more began to practice their rites. A total of 60,000 sages became disciples of the venerable Rishi Saraswata for the sake of acquiring their knowledge of the Vedas from him (9:51). The present day Goud Saraswat Brahmins who are Goud saraswat , Shenvis, Chitrapur saraswats, bhalvalikar, Rajapur Saraswats, and pednekars, have this event as part of their culture. This event is repeated again at (3:85):- At the forest of Tungaka in olden days sage Saraswata taught the Vedas to the ascetics. When the Vedas had been lost in consequence of the sages having URLotten them. Here (3:85) he is mentioned as the son of Angirasa. The asylum of Aditya, the place of Soma and the hermitage of Dadhichi were mentioned as adjacent places on the banks of Saraswati at (3:83). Here it is mentioned that Angirasa - a great sage belonging to the Saraswata race - was born in the ashram of Dadhichi . At (13:50) Saraswata is  mentioned as Sage Atris son. Saraswata is mentioned as a sage from the western regions of India at (12:207, 13:165).","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"Saraswata was brought up by Sage Dadhichi who found him as a child floating in the Saraswati River .

{"doc_id":54114327.0,"context":"Comparison with American flag 205px|The Grand Union Flag, 1775 The flag of the East India Company is considered to have inspired the 1775 Grand Union Flag, the first flag of the United States, as the two flags were of the same design. This connection is attributed to numerous sources. Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania once gave a speech endorsing the adoption of the Company's flag by the United States as their national flag. He said to George Washington of Virginia, \"While the field of your flag must be new in the details of its design, it need not be entirely new in its elements. There is already in use a flag, I refer to the flag of the East India Company.\" This was a way of symbolising American loyalty to the Crown as well as the United States' aspirations to be self-governing, as was the East India Company. Some colonists also felt that the Company could be a powerful ally in the American War of Independence, as they shared similar aims and grievances against Crown tax policies. Colonists therefore flew the Company's flag, to endorse the Company. However, the theory that the Grand Union Flag was a direct descendant of the flag of the East India Company has been criticised as lacking written evidence. On the other hand, the resemblance is obvious, and a number of the Founding Fathers of the United States were aware of the East India Company 's activities and of their free administration of India under Company rule.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"Comparison with American flag 205px|The Grand Union Flag, 1775 The flag of the East India Company is considered to have inspired the 1775 Grand Union Flag, the first flag of the United States, as the two flags were of the same design.","after_edit":"Comparison with American flag 205px|The Grand Union Flag, 1775 The flag of the East India Company may or may not have have inspired the 1775 Grand Union Flag, the first flag of the United States, as the two flags were of the same design.","label":"style","raw_intents":["style","style","style"]}
{"doc_id":38569161.0,"context":"170px|Textile doll (cotton, wool, wood) The Chancay were a pre-Columbian archeological civilization which developed between the valleys of Fortaleza, Pativilca, Supe, Huaura, Chancay, Chilln, Rimac and Lurn, on the central coast of Peru, from about CE 1000 to 1470. History 200px|Llama effigy (earthenware, slip paint) Not much is known about the Chancay civilization, which developed in the later part of the Inca Empire. This culture emerged after the fall of the Wari civilization. Parts of the southern Chancay area were conquered by the Chim in the early fifteenth century and in about 1450 A.D. the Incas were occupying both areas. It is believed that the Chancay had a centralized political structure , forming a small regional state. Thus the Chancay culture declined in the fifteenth centuryto make way for the territorial expansion of the Inca Empire . The settlements in Lauri, Lumbra, Tambo Blanco, Handrail, Pisquillo Chico and Tronconal focused mainly on artisans producing large-scale ceramics and textiles. The Chancay culture is the first of the Peruvian cultures that had mass production of ceramics, textiles and metals such as gold and silver which were ritualistic and domestic goods. They were also noted for their wood carved items. In type of fabric used include llama wool, cotton, chiffon  and feathers. Their technique involved were decorated open weave, brocade, embroidery, and painting. Brushes were used to paint anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, geometric and other creative designs directly on the canvases. The Chancay are known for the quality of their painted tapestries. The typically geometric designs also included drawings of plants, animals such as fish, cats, birds, monkeys and dogs (most notably the hairless Peruvian dog) as well as human figures. Some of the human fiber sculptures are elaborate and include such scenes as a mother teaching her daughter to weave on a backstrap loom. Birds and deities wearing crescent-like headdresses were one of the more common decorative features. They produced a variety of goods such as clothing, bags, and funeral masks.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" It is believed that the Chancay had a centralized political structure , forming a small regional state.","after_edit":" The Chancay likely had a centralized political structure , forming a small regional state.","label":"style","raw_intents":["style","style","clarity"]}
