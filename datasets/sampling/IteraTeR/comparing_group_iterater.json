The next year she appeared on The Howard Stern Show as a spokesmodel for Nutrisystem, and moved back to LosAngeles. Aniston also appeared in two more failed television comedy series , The Edge and Muddling Through, and guest-starred in Quantum Leap, Herman's Head , and Burke's Law. 19942004: Friends and worldwide recognition Depressed over her four unsuccessful television shows, Aniston approached Warren Littlefield at a Los Angeles gas station asking for reassurance. The head of NBC entertainment encouraged her to continue acting, and a few months later helped cast her in Friends, a sitcom that was set to debut on NBC's 19941995 fall lineup. The producer originally wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica Geller, but Courteney Cox was deemed more suitable . Thus, Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on Saturday Night Live, but turned it down in favor of Friends. She played Rachel until the show ended in 2004. upAniston at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival The program was a massive hit and Aniston, along with her co-stars, gained worldwide recognition among television viewers . Her character was widely popularand is now regarded as one of the greatest female characters in American television history. Aniston received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations (two for Supporting Actress, three for Lead Actress), including a win for Lead Actress. She was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards and won in 2003 as Best Actress Television Series Musical or Comedy. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Aniston (along with her female co-stars) became the highest-paid television actress of all time with her $1million-per-episode paycheck for the final season of Friends. Her character's relationship with Ross Geller, portrayed by David Schwimmer in the show, was widely popular among audiences, and the couple was frequently voted as television's favorite couple in polls and magazines. Following a four-year hiatus, Aniston returned to film work in 1996, when she performed in the ensemble cast of romantic comedy She's the One. Aniston's first starring vehicle was Picture Perfect (1997), in which she played a struggling young advertising executive opposite Kevin Bacon and Jay Mohr. While the film received mixed reviews, it was a moderate commercial success, and Aniston's performance was more warmly received, with many critics suggesting that she had screen presence. In 1998, she appeared as a woman who falls for a gay man (played by Paul Rudd) in the romantic comedy The Object of My Affection, and the next year she starred as a restaurant waitress in the cult film Office Space. Aniston appeared in the dramedy Rock Star (2001) opposite Mark Wahlberg and Dominic West. She starred in the independent dramedy The Good Girl (2002) as an unglamorous cashier who cheats on her husband. The film was a commercial success in limited release, taking in over $ 14million in North America. Film critic Roger Ebert declared it her breakthrough: Aniston's biggest commercial success in film has been the comedy Bruce Almighty (2003), in which she played the girlfriend of a television field reporter (Jim Carrey) offered the chance to be God for one week. With a worldwide box office gross of $484million, the film was the fifth-highest-grossing big screen production of the year. Aniston next starred as the old classmate of a tightly wound newly-wed in the romantic comedy Along Came Polly (2004), opposite Ben Stiller, which placed number one at the North American box office, earning $ 27.7million in its opening weekend; it eventually made $172million worldwide.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Aniston received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations (two for Supporting Actress, three for Lead Actress), including a win for Lead Actress.","after_edit":" Aniston received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations (two for Supporting Actress, three for Lead Actress), and won for Lead Actress.","start_sent_pos":1626,"end_sent_pos":1769,"raw_intents":["clarity","style","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a hooded vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan (now South Sudan), in March 1993, and to have survived the incident. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. Carter took his own life four months after winning the prize. Background The Hunger Triangle, a name URLanisations used in the 1990s for the area defined by the southern Sudan communities Kongor, Ayod, and Waat, was dependent on UNESCO and other URLanisations to fight famine. Forty percent of the area's children under 5 years old were malnourished as of January 1993, and an estimated 10 to 13 adults died of starvation daily in Ayod alone. To raise awareness of the situation, Operation Lifeline Sudan invited photojournalists and others, previously excluded from entering the country, to report on conditions. In March 1993, the government began granting visas to journalists for a 24-hour stay with severe restrictions on their travel within the country, including government supervision at all times. Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan. It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva saw this as a chance to work more as a war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested in going. According to fellow war photographer Greg Marinovich, Carter saw the trip as an opportunity to fix some problems \"he felt trapped in\". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\". To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have \"great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan pancake\", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: \"The UN hoped to publish the famine Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for URLanisations to sustain funding\". About the political differences and fighting \"Joo and Kevin knew none of this they just wanted to get in and shoot pictures\". Waiting in Nairobi Silva and Carter had prepared carefully for the trip. They stopped in Nairobi on their way to Sudan. The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region . But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod. In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards. The residents of the hamlet have been looked after by the UN aid station for some time. Greg Marinovich and Joo Silva described that in the book The Bang Bang Club, Chapter 10 \"Flies and Hungry People\". The child was already cared for before Kevin Carter and Joo Silva landed there and Carter took his famous picture. Marinovich wrote that the villagers were already waiting next to the runway to get the food as quickly as possible: \"Mothers who had joined the throng waiting for food left their children on the sandy ground nearby.\" Silva and Carter separated to take pictures of both children and adults, both the living and dead, all victims of the catastrophic famine that had arisen through the war. Carter went several times to Silva to tell him about the shocking situation he had just photographed. Witnessing the famine affected him emotionally. Silva was searching for rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority and when he found some soldiers Carter joined him. The soldiers did not speak English, but one was interested in Carter's watch. Carter gave him his cheap wristwatch as a gift. The soldiers became their bodyguards and followed them for their protection. To stay a week with the rebels they needed the permission of a rebel commander. Their plane was due to depart in an hour and without the permission to stay they would be forced to fly out. Again they separated and Silva went to the clinic complex to ask for the rebel commander and he was told the commander was in Kongor, South Sudan. This was good news for Silva, as \"their little UN plane was heading there next\". He left the clinic and went back to the runway, taking pictures of children and adults on his way. He came across a child lying on his face in the hot sun he took a picture. In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of \"fevers\", according to his family.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region .","after_edit":" Carter flew with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region .","start_sent_pos":3131,"end_sent_pos":3265,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","coherence"],"label":"clarity"}

It was almost identical to the 16-inch gun on Barbados, being 119ft long, but was limited by a 35-mile range restriction. However, unlike the Barbados gun, its projectiles could be recovered since they were not lost in the ocean upon their journey back down.

The slender design of the tube which contained the rocket's payload  was very narrow and long, limiting what objects could be inserted into the tube. This limitation on size was extremely inconvenient when considering the future proposed payloads of Martlet rockets which included satellites and space probes. The cannon-like design also eliminated the capacity for crewed space travel as well as the launching of satellites carrying extremely sensitive scientific instruments and payloads due to the extreme acceleration placed on the projectile during firing. Martlet 2A, 2B, 2C family The Martlet 2A, 2B, and 2C represented the earliest of the Martlet 2 16-inch (406mm) test projectiles. Marlet 2A was designed simultaneously with the Martlet 1 with a range of interest being 70 to 200 kilometers. Most carried multi-type research payloads studying the upper atmosphere and near-space conditions. Due to their low cost per missile launch, they were used to test out single payloads. Despite similarities in missile air frame , the Martlet 2A, 2B, and 2C featured differences in their structural materials and mechanical details. For the Martlet 2A, the liquid payload was loaded into an aluminum, tapered liner inside the missile body. But by the development of the Martlet 2C series, the aluminum insert was abandoned altogether to allow the liquid payload to be housed in contact with the steel body, increasing the quantity of the liquid payload that could be carried.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" The slender design of the tube which contained the rocket's payload  was very narrow and long, limiting what objects could be inserted into the tube.","after_edit":" The slender design of the tube which contained the rocket's payload , was very narrow and long, limiting what objects could be inserted into the tube.","start_sent_pos":1929,"end_sent_pos":2079,"raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"],"label":"fluency"}

{"doc_id":804964.0,"context":"Language Dehumanization and dehumanized perception can occur as a result of the language used to describe groups of people. Words such as migrant, immigrant, and expatriate are assigned to foreigners based on their social status and wealth, rather than ability, achievements, or political alignment. Expatriate is a word to describe the privileged, often light-skinned people newly residing in an area and has connotations that suggest ability, wealth, and trust. Meanwhile, the word immigrant is used to describe people coming to a new location to reside and infers a much less-desirable meaning. Further, \"immigrant\" is a word that can be paired with \"illegal\", which harbors a profoundly negative connotationto those projecting social cognition towards the other. The perpetual misuse of these words used to describe the other in the English language can alter the perception of a group in a derogatory way. \"Most of the time when we hear illegal immigrant%DIFDELCMD < ] %%% used, most of the time, the shorter version 'illegals' is being used as a noun, which implies that a human being is perpetually illegal.

One pair of studies found that subjects were more likely to associate malignant language with homosexuals, and that such language associations increased the physical distancing between the subject and the homosexual.

According to the Humane Society, most internet hunts involve game ranches where animals are kept penned, making them essentially canned hunts.Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, Another less well-known incident occurred  two years prior to the Dick Cheney hunting incident when the vice president participated in a canned hunt at the Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania. Cheney and nine companions killed 417 out of 500 ringneck pheasants, of which the Vice President killed 70, and an unknown number of mallard ducks. In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country. South Africa environment minister announced long-awaited restrictions on lion hunting, declaring he was sickened by wealthy tourists shooting tame lions from the back of a truck and felling rhinos with a bow and arrow. This comes in response to the imbroglio created over the potential canned hunt of the African rhinoceros 'Baixinha.' Dismissing threats of legal action by the hunting industry, Marthinus Van Schalkwyk said the new law would ban \"canned\" hunting of big predators and rhinos in small enclosures that offer them no means of escape. In addition, lions bred in captivity would have to be released into the open for at least two years before they could be hunted. Van Schalkwyk said a previously proposed six-month delay would not give lions enough time to develop self-defence instincts. \"Hunting should be about fair chase ... testing the wits of a hunter against that of the animal,\" he told a press conference. \"Over the years that got eroded and now we are trying to re-establish that principle.\" This measure was later overturned. In May 2007 a much-reported hunting trip involved the killing of 1,051pound pet pig in an alleged canned hunt. The pig was named \"Monster Pig\" by the media and it was believed that the pig was a feral hog . It was soon discovered that the pig, previously named \"Fred , \"  had been someone's pet and was then sold to a hunting facility only a brief time before he was killed. On May 3, paying customers Mike Stone and his 11-year-old son , Jamison , hunted him in a fenced enclosure. Jamison shot Fred a total of eight times over a period of three hours. A June 2007 story on CNN detailed canned hunting in South Africa and includes a video of a canned lion hunt where the animal is shot against a fence. On November 30, 2014, CBS  60 Minutes broadcast a story (\"The Lion Whisperer\") about one man's sanctuary in South Africa for 26 lions, raised in captivity, who he rescued from the fate of canned lion hunting. In November 2015, the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa (PHASA) voted to disassociate itself from the practice of canned lion hunting in South Africa. Unless the conservation value of canned lion hunting is demonstrated to PHASA, URLanization will remain against the practice and, under penalty of expulsion, no PHASA members will be permitted to participate canned lion hunts. In November 2017  PHASA came under fire over the body's reversal of its 2015 policy against the hunting of captive-bred lions.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country.","after_edit":" In 2006, the South African Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country.","start_sent_pos":715,"end_sent_pos":885,"raw_intents":["meaning-changed","meaning-changed","meaning-changed"],"label":"meaning-changed"}

An axial river existed in the Espanola Basin as early as 13 million years ago, reaching the Santo Domingo Basin by 6.9 million years ago. However, at this time, the river drained into a playa in the southern Albuquerque Basin where it deposited the Popotosa Formation.

While many algorithms exploit this fact in summary generation , it has a detrimental effect on teaching the model to discriminate and extract important information in general. We propose that the lead bias can be leveraged in our favor in a simple and effective way to pre-train abstractive news summarization models on large-scale unlabeled news corpora: predicting the leading sentences using the rest of an article. We collect a massive news corpus and conduct data cleaning and filtering via statistical analysis. We then apply the proposed self-supervised pre-training  to existing generation models BART and T5 for domain adaptation. Via extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, we show that this approach can dramatically improve the summarization quality and achieve state-of-the-art results for zero-shot news summarization without any fine-tuning. For example, in the DUC2003 dataset, the ROUGE-1 score of BART increases 13.7\\% after the lead-bias pre-training.

Many people want to enjoy the conveniences brought by new technology, but they may not be aware of its problems. WiMAX , which is a communication standard is mainly promoted by the Taipei Computer Association, in addition to the Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China , is considered by some to be the next generation in mobile devices. Since several Internet crimes are progressively respected by several information security companies , some of them disputed on security of WiMAX. After all, everyone wants to welcome this new technology but is afraid of its problem to bring about security issues. Although some (security) companies analyzed statistics on potential issues to dispute the future of WiMAX, but the question is how will they present their analysis? With opportunities from  two press conferences in Taiwan, Wikinews Journalist Rico Shen briefly and successively interviewed Hsiao-wen Hung, President of Microsoft Research Asia and Li Chang, Deputy Secretary General of Taipei Computer Association.

Prior to the  (Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Server 2008) launch, although WiMAX, a next-generation networking technology, will bring on the growth of mobile users, but its future was ever disputed by some companies from information security industry. Hung: Safety and flexibility , its relation is like a paddle . If something wanted to be linkable anywhere, there were still some considerations on security . It's like a house which anyone can enter in it . If you want to ensure its safety on your house, you should doseveral hard works . That's why the security is a must-have trend in reality. As of information securitywhat you mentioned about before , relatively, if a newly-proposed future technology wasn't normally populated, it's a golden opportunity for companies when some security companies properly disputed on its future. Hung: Even though it's safe to lock everything all, but it is inconvenience to lock (them all) . Therefore, some key elements like encryption, password authentication, policy, and some Web 2.0 solutions played key roles in information security. There were some involuntary and deliberate attackers on the Internet , if anyone want to prevent them, a complete planning should do priory .

Analysis of the survey results found a significant positive correlation between the religiosity of members and their participation in twelve-step addiction recovery groups and SMART Recovery, although the correlation factor was three times smaller for SMART Recovery than for the twelve-step addiction recovery groups. Religiosity was inversely related to participation in Secular Organizations for Sobriety.

{"doc_id":5233272.0,"context":"History In the late 19th century, Portugal's dominance of Mozambique was threatened by the expansionist colonial ambitions of Great Britain and Germany . Although the borders of Mozambique had nominally been fixed by the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, Portugal lacked the capital to exert effective control or  exploitation of the territory. To help overcome this, in 1891 the Portuguese government authorised three private companies by royal charter to manage portions of Mozambique: the Mozambique Company, the Zambezi Company and the Niassa Company. In 1913-14, a German banking consortium bought a majority of the shares of the Niassa Company, aiming at a partition of  Mozambique between Germany and Great Britain. With the outbreak of World War I , the British government confiscated  German equities and handed them over to an English financial group led by Owen Philipps, chairman of the Union-Castle Line, which did much business in Portuguese East Africa, but which found the concession to be more of a liability. During the war, the Niassa Company's territory was the scene of several  resistance operations by the local chiefs aided by the Germans (including in the Kionga Triangle). To resist this invasion, more than 300 kilometers of roads were opened. This also meant the effective occupation of the Mueda Plateau, which was occupied by the heavily-armed Makonde people. The Niassa Company only managed to suppress the Makonde by the early 1920s, and the tribe later became the backbone of the FRELIMO movement in the 1960s and 1970s against continued Portuguese colonial rule. In addition, the company relied on a hut tax , modelled after the system in British East Africa . Although theoretically a tax on each dwelling, in reality the tax was on each adult person, which could be paid in cash or in produce. The hut tax, which was two escudo in 1921 was increased to 50 escudo in 1927 and to 85 escudo in 1929. This was party due to devaluation of the escudo, but was also due to a dwindling tax base, as thousands of Mozambicans sought refuge in Tanganyika or Nyasaland to avoid the tax. As a tax of 50 escudo was the equivalent of three months paid labor, many people fell deeply into debt or forced labor.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" During the war, the Niassa Company's territory was the scene of several  resistance operations by the local chiefs aided by the Germans (including in the Kionga Triangle).","after_edit":" During the war, the Niassa Company's territory was the scene of several anti-Portuguese resistance operations by the local chiefs aided by the Germans (including in the Kionga Triangle).","start_sent_pos":1024,"end_sent_pos":1196,"raw_intents":["clarity","meaning-changed","meaning-changed"],"label":"meaning-changed"}

{"doc_id":55503854.0,"context":"Relation to traditional epistemology Traditional epistemology and Bayesian epistemology are both forms of epistemology, but they differ in various respects, for example, concerning their methodology, the propositional attitudes they study , the role justification or confirmation plays in them and some of their research interests. Bayesian epistemology focuses on degrees of belief, also often called credences. On the other hand, Traditional epistemology focuses on knowledge, analyzed by Plato as being justified true beliefs . They then seek to understand what counts as knowledgeand how to evaluate one's beliefs (see foundationalism, coherentism, and the problem of philosophical skepticism or the question of whether knowledge is possible at all ) . Bayesian epistemology, on the other hand, works by formalizing concepts and problems, which are often vague in the traditional approach. It thereby focuses more on mathematical intuitions and promises a higher degree of precision. It sees belief as a continuous phenomenon that comes in various degrees, so-called credences. Some Bayesians have even suggested that the regular notion of belief should be abandoned. But there are also proposals to connect the two, for example, the Lockean thesis, which defines belief as credence above a certain threshold. Justification plays a central role in traditional epistemology while Bayesians have focused on the related notions of confirmation and disconfirmation through evidence. The notion of evidence is important for both approaches but only the traditional approach has been interested in studying the sources of evidence, like perception and memory.

He is also a former Member of Parliament and mutineer, having led a mutiny of Trinidad and Tobago Regiment in 1970. He was born the son of a sugar cane worker and housewife in March 1946. His early education was at Presentation College, Chaguanas, where he gained a Grade I Cambridge School Certificate. He later won a cadetship to the prestigious British Royal Military Academy Sandhurst between 1964 and 1966. As a Lieutenant in the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment, he led an army mutiny in 1970. In the midst of Black Power riots, the People's National Movement government led by Eric Williams proclaimed a State of Emergency April, 1970 and arrested several Black Power leaders and Trade Unionists. In a move to prevent Williams from using the military against the masses, a portion of the Regiment stationed at Teteron (on the Chaguaramas Peninsula), led by Lieutenants Shah and Rex Lassalle mutinied. In response, the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard fired on the mutineers who returned to Teteron Barracks, abandoning their foray into Port of Spain. After ten days the mutineers surrendered. The leaders were court-martialed and Shah and Lasalle were jailed. They both went on to win their appeals at the local Court of Appeal, and judges at the Privy Council in London, England, ruled against the State's appeal in July , 1972. Shah, Lassalle and all the other mutineers were freed within 24 hours of that ruling. After being released from prison Shah joined the Trade Union movement leading the ICFTU, a body of cane farmers who sought to displace the government URLanisation, TICFA . He , URLe Weekes and Basdeo Panday went on to found the United Labour Front  in 1975 as a labor confederation and transformed it into a political party in 1976. During general election later that year, the ULF secured 10 of the 36 seats in Parliament and became the official Opposition. Basdeo Panday was appointed Leader of the Opposition, but following a bitter row in the party, Shah was able to displace him, and served as Leader of the Opposition between August 9, 1977 and March 31, 1978 when Panday regained control of the party. Shah went on to lead the cane farmers and won an election to head the Trinidad Islandwide Cane Farmers' Association (TICFA), in 1998. He has been chairman of URLanisation to date. Shah also served as editor of the Trinidad and Tobago Mirror newspaper for 17 years and today serves as an op-ed columnist in the Trinidad  Express newspaper. He is also known as the man who founded the prestigious annual Clico Trinidad & Tobago International Marathon, an event that spawned road running throughout the Caribbean.

The second group of needs is those of relatedness the desire people have for maintaining important interpersonal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs: an intrinsic desire for personal development. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization. Alderfer categorized the lower order needs (Physiological and Safety) into the Existence category. He fit Maslow's interpersonal love and esteem needs into the Relatedness category. The Growth category contained the self-actualization and self-esteem needs  . Alderfer also proposed a  regression theory to go along with the ERG theory . He said that when needs in a higher category are not met then individuals redouble the efforts invested in a lower category need .

As the world's ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, it is integral to life on Earth , forms part of the carbon cycle and water cycle, and - as a huge heat reservoir - influences climate and weather patterns.  Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones defined by physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column of the open ocean, and can be divided into further regions categorized by light abundance and by depth. The photic zone includes the oceans from the surface to a depth of 200m; it is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is, therefore, the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) allows them to URLanic matter from chemical precursors including water and carbon dioxide. It is this upper sunlit ocean that creates the food supply that ultimately sustains most of the ocean ecosystem.

{"doc_id":25893514.0,"context":"When breast cancer is surgically excised, it can come back (local recurrence) in the remaining breast or on the chest wall in a small proportion of women. Adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary if breast cancer is treated by removing only the cancerous lump with a rim of surrounding normal tissue, as it reduces the chance of local recurrence significantly . When cancer does come back, it most commonly occurs in the tissues surrounding the original cancer (the tumour bed), even though there are multicentric cancers in remote areas of the breast. This suggests that it is most important to treat the tumour bed. The rationale for TARGIT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the tumour bed. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumour have been time tested and proven to be effective. EBRT is usually given as a course of whole breast radiotherapy and an additional tumour bed boost  . However, it has a few drawbacks; for example, the tumour bed where the boost dose should be applied can be missed (\"geographical miss\") due to the difficulties in localization of the complex wound cavity  even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay (\"temporal miss\") between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumour cells  . These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumour cells. Furthermore, TARGIT inhibits the stimulating effects of wound fluid on cancer cells, suggesting for the first time, a beneficial effect of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) on tumour microenvironment. In these studies, women treated with  TARGIT-IORT  during lumpectomy for breast cancer combined with whole breast radiotherapy had a significantly low mortality from non-breast-cancer causes, such as cardiovascular and lung complications, as well as other cancers compared with those who received whole breast radiotherapy. Therefore, this reduction was thought to be due to the delivery of TARGIT-IORT to the fresh tumour bed during the trauma of surgery rather than avoidance of scattered radiation from whole breast radiotherapy .","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Furthermore, TARGIT inhibits the stimulating effects of wound fluid on cancer cells, suggesting for the first time, a beneficial effect of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) on tumour microenvironment.

The innovator's dilemma: When new technologies cause great firms to fail. Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I.

History 200px|Llama effigy (earthenware, slip paint) Not much is known about the Chancay civilization, which developed in the later part of the Inca Empire. This culture emerged after the fall of the Wari civilization. Parts of the southern Chancay area were conquered by the Chim in the early fifteenth century and in about 1450 A.D. the Incas were occupying both areas. It is believed that the Chancay had a centralized political structure , forming a small regional state. Thus the Chancay culture declined in the fifteenth centuryto make way for the territorial expansion of the Inca Empire . The settlements in Lauri, Lumbra, Tambo Blanco, Handrail, Pisquillo Chico and Tronconal focused mainly on artisans producing large-scale ceramics and textiles. The Chancay culture is the first of the Peruvian cultures that had mass production of ceramics, textiles and metals such as gold and silver which were ritualistic and domestic goods. They were also noted for their wood carved items. In type of fabric used include llama wool, cotton, chiffon  and feathers. Their technique involved were decorated open weave, brocade, embroidery, and painting. Brushes were used to paint anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, geometric and other creative designs directly on the canvases. The Chancay are known for the quality of their painted tapestries. The typically geometric designs also included drawings of plants, animals such as fish, cats, birds, monkeys and dogs (most notably the hairless Peruvian dog) as well as human figures. Some of the human fiber sculptures are elaborate and include such scenes as a mother teaching her daughter to weave on a backstrap loom.

So far, most of the past works concentrate on selecting or generating one pertinent and fluent response according to current query and its context. These models work on a one-to-one environment, making one response to one utterance each round.However, in real human-human conversations, human often sequentially sends several short messages for readability instead of a long message in one turn. Thus messages will not end with an explicit ending signal, which is crucial for agents to decide when to reply. So the first step for an intelligent dialogue agent is not replying but deciding if it should reply at the moment. To address this issue, in this paper , we propose a novel Imagine-then-Arbitrate (ITA) neural dialogue model to help the agent decide whether to wait or to make a response directly. Our method has two imaginator modules and an arbitrator module. The two imaginators will learn the agent's and user's speaking style respectively, generate possible utterances as the input of the arbitrator, combining with dialogue history. And the arbitrator decides whether to wait or to make a response to the user directly. To verify the performance and effectiveness of our method, we prepared two dialogue datasets and compared our approach with several popular models.

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification;","after_edit":" Some new global histories resemble the academic histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification;","start_sent_pos":2586,"end_sent_pos":2791,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","meaning-changed"],"label":"clarity"}

Such alignment-based approaches are both intuitive and interpretable; however, they are empirically inferior to the simple cosine similarity between general-purpose sentence vectors. To remedy this , we focus on  the fact that the norm of word vectors is a good proxy for word importance, and the angle of them is a good proxy for word similarity. Alignment-based approaches do not distinguish the norm and direction , whereas sentence-vector approaches automatically use the norm as the word importance. Accordingly, we propose to decouple word vectors into their norm and direction then computing the alignment-based similarity using earth mover's distance (  optimal transport cost), which we refer to as word rotator's distance.

The propaganda campaign, which specifically targets 14 to 19 year-olds aims to reduce the number of young people experimenting with the soft drug. The advertisements are the result of a tightening of cannabis laws in NSW last year. The propaganda , which NSW Health has cost at AUD$600,000 , that could of been spent on feeding starving children, will use a variety of print ads placed at bus stops and in youth magazines in addition to propaganda messages on websites such as MySpace and MSN. Propaganda ads use a tag line saying \"Pot. It mightn't kill you, but it could turn politicians into dickheads \". The propaganda images show a person staring from a black and white photo with quotes like \"You've got great eyes, dialated eyes are hot \" and \"I'd lend you money, but the government would just spend it on these ads \" , as part of an emotional appeal to manipulate the reader into an unfair bias on the topic, instead of comparing facts and science to the message they are promoting . The director of drug and alcohol programs with NSW Health, David McGrath said many young people know that cannabis was safe and its use was normal. \"There is still a significant cohort of people who think, particularly with the young person's age group, that cannabis is normal,\" Mr McGrath said. Mr McGrath said despite the number of young cannabis users had halved from forty percent to twenty percent, but claimed more needed to be done. \"We want to prevent people who are thinking about taking cannabis up from taking it up and also encouraging those people that are using cannabis to cease, through use of unrelenting lies and social shunning \" he said. Mr McGrath said young people had to be warned about the possible consequences of smoking cannabis, such as the alleged link with comedians and how it may improve social interaction and physical health.

The agreement was negotiated and concluded in Brussels under the auspices of the European Union and signed on 19 April 2013. Negotiations were led by Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Da\u010di\u0107 and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Tha\u00e7i and mediated by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton. The government of Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as a sovereign state, but began normalizing relations with the government of Kosovo nonetheless, in accordance with the Brussels URL In 2018, Serbia's president Aleksandar Vucic commented that the agreement is a difficult compromise for Serbia, which according to him fulfilled all of its obligations. Background Following the Kosovo War and NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Kosovo, as part of Serbia and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was placed under United Nations administration under UNSC Resolution 1244. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence and has since been recognized by 98 countries. However, Serbia maintains that Kosovo continues to be its territory. Kosovo has become a member of several international organizations, while according to Serbia and about half of the UN member states, Resolution 1244 remains legally binding on all parties.

Baroness Ashton, the EU High Representative, had been chairing talks for two years, followed by Federica Mogherini. Normalization of relations with neighboring states is a key precondition for states wishing to join the EU; the Brussels Agreement brought Serbia close to EU accession talks and Kosovo to initialing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). The SAA was signed by HR Mogherini and PM Mustafa in October 2015.

United States diplomats have supported the EU-led dialogue from the beginning. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton invited Baroness Ashton to undertake joint travel in the Balkans, and the two made joint visits to Belgrade and Pristina (as well as Sarajevo) in October 2012. Clinton assigned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State ambassador Philip Reeker to support Ashton's efforts. Reeker and his team coordinated closely with EU colleagues and met with Serbian and Kosovar representatives on the margins of every dialogue session in Brussels, and during visits to the region. The result was the 15-point \"First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalisation of Relations\", initialed but not signed on 19 April 2013.

In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I.

The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered 'real' options.

The Martlet 2G-1 was a proposed space launch vehicle variant of Martlet 2G, which had a solid rocket motor in the projectile.

In the picture is MTube, innovated by Science and Technology Advisory Group of Executive Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Computers and technology bring several conveniences to the modern lifestyle , but it creates risks like computer viruses and hacking. Many people want to enjoy the conveniences brought by new technology, but they may not be aware of its problems. WiMAX , which is a communication standard is mainly promoted by the Taipei Computer Association, in addition to the Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China , is considered by some to be the next generation in mobile devices. Since several Internet crimes are progressively respected by several information security companies , some of them disputed on security of WiMAX. After all, everyone wants to welcome this new technology but is afraid of its problem to bring about security issues. Although some (security) companies analyzed statistics on potential issues to dispute the future of WiMAX, but the question is how will they present their analysis? With opportunities from  two press conferences in Taiwan, Wikinews Journalist Rico Shen briefly and successively interviewed Hsiao-wen Hung, President of Microsoft Research Asia and Li Chang, Deputy Secretary General of Taipei Computer Association. With their experiences in the IT industry, they agreed to comment on this question. __NOTOC__ Hsiao-wen Hung: Information security isn't built within a day . Hsiao-wen Hung: The information security industry isn't built within a simple solution. (Interview audio clip) The improvements of information technology firmly brought on  opportunities, but information security is particularly respected by companies from security industry, As of this , how about the information security? Prior to the  (Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Server 2008) launch, although WiMAX, a next-generation networking technology, will bring on the growth of mobile users, but its future was ever disputed by some companies from information security industry. Hung: Safety and flexibility , its relation is like a paddle . If something wanted to be linkable anywhere, there were still some considerations on security . It's like a house which anyone can enter in it . If you want to ensure its safety on your house, you should doseveral hard works . That's why the security is a must-have trend in reality. As of information securitywhat you mentioned about before , relatively, if a newly-proposed future technology wasn't normally populated, it's a golden opportunity for companies when some security companies properly disputed on its future. Hung: Even though it's safe to lock everything all, but it is inconvenience to lock (them all) . Therefore, some key elements like encryption, password authentication, policy, and some Web 2.0 solutions played key roles in information security. There were some involuntary and deliberate attackers on the Internet , if anyone want to prevent them, a complete planning should do priory . That's why the information security industry is built with several solutions and long-term experiences but not a simple solution in a day. Li Chang: Convergences will be brought for security and IT industries . Li Chang: Convergences will be brought for security and IT industries besides of changes on WiMAX. (Interview audio clip) What's your opinion on several disputes from IS companies during the \"2008 Asia-pacific Information Security Forum\"? Chang: Our member companies will do attempts on trend-changing. As of our board committee, because (our member) companies mostly manufactured notebook computers, if a common consensus from several senior officers from IT industrywill be established , I think the objects of TCA will be more and more cleared . What's your opinion on Hsiao-wen Hung's word, \"When people want to enjoy a new technology, some protections should be necessity \"? Chang: It's an undoubted truth. When a new technology was under development, companies mostly looked on its vision rather than its hidden factors like information or data security. As the Internet just began in a mature infrastructure, the public might not know its critical issue on security factor.

The ocean is divided into five oceans : Pacific (the largest) , Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic (the smallest). Seawater covers approximately of the Earth. As the world's ocean is the principal component of Earth's hydrosphere, it is integral to life on Earth , forms part of the carbon cycle and water cycle, and - as a huge heat reservoir - influences climate and weather patterns.  Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones defined by physical and biological conditions. The pelagic zone consists of the water column of the open ocean, and can be divided into further regions categorized by light abundance and by depth. The photic zone includes the oceans from the surface to a depth of 200m; it is the region where photosynthesis can occur and is, therefore, the most biodiverse. Photosynthesis by plants and microscopic algae (free floating phytoplankton) allows them to URLanic matter from chemical precursors including water and carbon dioxide. It is this upper sunlit ocean that creates the food supply that ultimately sustains most of the ocean ecosystem. Light only penetrates to a few hundred meters depth, so the remaining ocean below this is cold and dark. The continental shelf around the edge of the oceans is shallower (a few hundred meters or less) and this region is most impacted by human activity.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"  Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones defined by physical and biological conditions.","after_edit":"  Oceanographers divide the ocean into different vertical and horizontal zones based on physical and biological conditions.","start_sent_pos":750,"end_sent_pos":875,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","style"],"label":"clarity"}

{"doc_id":25664190.0,"context":"Love Socrates and Alcibiades, by Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg There exist textual passages suggesting that Socrates had a love affair with Alcibiades and other young males  while other texts suggest that Socrates' friendship with young boys sought  to improve them and were not sexual. In URLias, Socrates claims he was a dual lover of Alcibiades and philosophy, and his flirtatiousness is evident in Protagoras, Meno (76ac) and Phaedrus (227cd). However, the exact nature of the relation is not clear since Socrates was known for his self-restraint, while Alcibiades admits in the Symposium that he had tried to seduce Socrates but failed. The Socratic theory of love is mostly deduced from Lysis, where Socrates talks about love at a wrestling school with Lysis and his friends. They start their dialogue by investigating parental love and how it manifests with respect to the freedom and boundaries they set for their child. Socrates concludes that if Lysis is utterly useless, nobody will love him, not even his parents. While most scholars consider this text to be humorous in intention, Gregory Vlastos suggests that it reveals the Socratic doctrine on love, which is an egoistic one, according to which we only love people that are useful to us in some way. Others scholars disagree with Vlastos' view; some argue that Socrates leaves room for non-egoistical love for a spouse, while others deny that Socrates is suggesting any egoistical motivation at all. A form of utility children have for parents, as Socrates claims in Symposium, is that they offer the false impression of immortality. Scholars note that for Socrates, love is rational.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" They start their dialogue by investigating parental love and how it manifests with respect to the freedom and boundaries they set for their child.","after_edit":" They start their dialogue by investigating parental love and how it manifests with respect to the freedom and boundaries which parents set for their child.","start_sent_pos":782,"end_sent_pos":929,"raw_intents":["clarity","style","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

{"doc_id":18309949.0,"context":"A discordant system or pattern does not correlate to the topography and geology of the area. Discordant drainage patterns are classified into two main types: antecedent and superimposed, while anteposition drainage patterns combine the two. In antecedent drainage, a river's vertical incision ability matches that of land uplift due to tectonic forces. Superimposed drainage develops differently: initially, a drainage system develops on a surface composed of 'younger' rocks, but due to denudative activities this surface of younger rocks is removed and the river continues to flow over a seemingly new surface, but one in fact made up of rocks of old geological formation. Dendritic drainage patterns Dendritic drainage pattern Dendritic drainage systems (from Greek , dendrites, \"of or like a tree\") are not straight and are the most common form of  drainage system. In this, there are many sub-tributaries (analogous to the twigs of a tree), which merge into tributaries of the main river (the branches and the trunk of the tree, respectively). They are seen to feed a river channel that matches and is strongly accordant to the overriding gradient of the land. Truly dendritic systems form in V-shaped valleys; as a result, the rock types must be quite  impervious and non-porous. Trellis drainage pattern The geometry of a trellis drainage system is similar to that of a common garden trellis. Along a strike valley, smaller tributaries feed into from the steep slopes of mountain sides . These tributaries enter the main river about perpendicular, causing a trellis-like appearance of the system. They form where hard and soft formations exist on both banks of the main river, and are reflective of height, accentuated by erosion. Trellis drainage is characteristic of folded mountains, such as the Appalachian Mountains in North America and in the north part of Trinidad.Ritter, Michael E., The Physical Environment: an Introduction to Physical Geography. 2006 Rectangular drainage pattern Rectangular drainage develops on rocks that are of approximately uniform resistance to erosion, but which have two directions of jointing at approximately right angles or 90 degrees. The joints are usually less resistant to erosion than the bulk rock so erosion tends to preferentially open the joints and streams eventually develop along the joints. The result is a stream system in which streams consist mainly of straight line segments with right angle bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles. This pattern can be found with the Arun River in Nepal.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Discordant drainage patterns are classified into two main types: antecedent and superimposed, while anteposition drainage patterns combine the two.","after_edit":" Discordant drainage patterns are classified into two main types: antecedent and superimposed, while ante position drainage patterns combine the two.","start_sent_pos":92,"end_sent_pos":240,"raw_intents":["clarity","fluency","fluency"],"label":"fluency"}

{"doc_id":29326123.0,"context":"Research has examined goal orientation as a motivation variable that is useful for recruitment, climate and culture, performance appraisal, and choice.DeGeest, D., & Brown, K. G. (2011). The role of goal orientation in leadership development. Human Resource Development Quarterly, 22(2), 157-175. Studies have also used goal orientation to predict sales performance, adaptive performanceStasielowicz, L. (2019). Goal orientation and performance adaptation: A meta-analysis. Journal of Research in Personality, 82., goal setting, learning and adaptive behaviors in training, and leadership. Historical perspective Dweck proposed that there are two types of goal orientation: learning orientation and performance orientation.Dweck, C.S. (1986). Motivational processes affecting learning. American Psychologist, 41, 1040-1048. Dweck postulated that children with learning goals were believed to approach situations to master the acquisition of new skills, while children with performance goals were believed to approach situations to gain approval from peers and teachers. Like Eison, Dweck conceptualized goal orientation as a two-dimension construct. Individuals with a learning goal orientation (sometimes referred to as mastery goal orientation; abbreviated as LGO) seek to develop their competence by acquiring new skills and mastering new situations. They are not concerned about their performance relative to others, but rather with furthering their understanding of a given topic or task.Hendricks, J.W., & Payne, S.C. (2007). Beyond the Big Five: Leader goal orientation as a predictor of leadership effectiveness. Human Performance, 20, 317-343. Individuals with a performance goal orientation seek to demonstrate and validate the adequacy of their competence to receive favorable compliments while avoiding negative judgments. Although Dweck's work in this area built on the foundation laid by Nicholls, the fundamental difference between the two scholars' works was the attribution of an individual's goal orientation: Nicholls believed that the goal orientation held by an individual was a result of the possession of either an internal or external referent, while Dweck considered the adoption of a particular goal orientation to be related to the theory of intelligence held by that individual. Subsequent work by Eison and colleagues in 1982 led to a change in the conceptualization of these orientations from two ends of a continuum to two separate constructs.Eison, J.A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1982). LOGO II: A user's manual. Knoxville: University of Tennessee, Learning Research Center. More recently, researchers have embraced the idea that individuals can adopt the two orientation styles simultaneously: persons can be independently high or low in learning and performance orientations. Ultimately, individuals can entertain multiple competing goal orientations at the same time, and strive to both outperform competitors and improve their performance. This line of thinking led to the conceptualization of two separate continua: one for learning goal orientation and one for performance goal orientation.Eison, J. A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1986). Educational and personal characteristics of four different types of learning- and grade-oriented students. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 11, 5467. State versus trait There has been great debate as to whether goal orientation should be operationalized as a state or as a trait. Throughout the goal orientation literature, there are inconsistencies about the conceptualization of the stability of the construct. For example, DeShon & Gillespie stated that in the literature, DeShon, R. P., & Gillespie, J. Z. (2005). A motivated action theory account of goal orientation. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(6), 1096-1127. goal orientation has been conceptualized as a trait, quasi-trait, and state. They states that whether researchers conceptualize goal orientation as a trait or a state \"depends on the breadth of the inference that the researcher is attempting to support\". State goal orientation refers to the goal one has in a particular situation . It is similar to trait goal orientation in that it represents one's preference in an achievement situation. Button, Mathieu, & Zajac take an integrative view of the construct,Button, S. B., Mathieu, J. E., & Zajac, D. M. (1996, July). Goal orientation URLanizational research: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 67(1), 26-48. stating that goal orientation is best categorized as a relatively stable individual difference variable that can be influenced by situational and contextual characteristics. They found that when few situational cues are present, individuals will adopt their dispositional goal orientations. However, when \"dispositional goal orientations predispose individuals to adopt particular response patterns across situations, situational characteristics may cause them to adopt a different or less acute response pattern for a specific situation\". Therefore, trait and state goal orientations interact, and both should be considered simultaneously. Types Since the realization that performance goal orientation is most effectively split into two separate parts, researchers have conducted validation studies to demonstrate the statistical and conceptual distinction of three dimensions to goal orientation. Conceptual and empirical work by Elliot and Church and VandeWalle demonstrated that the factor structure of goal orientation lends itself to three distinct dimensions as summarized below .Elliot, A. J. Church, M. A. (1997). A hierarchical model of approach and avoidance achievement motivation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, 218-232. An explanation of the learning-approach and learning-avoidance goal orientations are also included for completeness. Antecedents Throughout the goal orientation literature, many studies have examined relationships between goal orientation and various antecedents. These antecedents have been identified to have varying levels of importance. In a meta-analysis by Payne et al., both the need for achievement and the Big Five personality traits were identified as important antecedents of goal orientation, while cognitive ability was found to have almost no relationship with goal orientation. The following sections go into more detail about each antecedent. Payne and her colleagues did not distinguish between proximal and distal antecedents. Another factor to consider when examining the relationship between goal orientation and goal setting is the level of inherent complexity in the situation or task. In situations with more complex tasks, it appears that \"do your best\" goals may lead to higher performance than specific goals. It is possible that in complex tasks, a specific, difficult goal imposes greater cognitive demands on employees, making it difficult for them to learn the complex task due to this increased pressure.Latham, G.P & Seijts, G.H. (1999). The effects of proximal and distal goals on performance on a moderately complex task. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 2, 81-127. Kanfer and Ackerman found that in an air traffic controller simulation (a highly complex task),Kanfer, R. Ackerman, P. L. (1989). Motivation and cognitive abilities: An integrative\/aptitude-treatment interaction approach to skill acquisition. Journal of Applied Psychology, 74, 657-690. performance-outcome goals interfered with acquiring the knowledge necessary to perform the task, and individuals performed better when they were asked to do their best, suggesting that adopting a learning orientation may be appropriate for complex tasks or in specific settings. However, it may be possible to set a specific, difficult learning goal. Latham and Brown found that when MBA students set specific, difficult learning goals such as mastering complex course material,Latham, G. P. Brown, T. C. (2006). The effect of learning vs. outcome goals on self-efficacy and satisfaction in an MBA program. Applied Psychology: An International Review, 55, 606-623. they outperformed MBA students who set a performance goal for GPA. Locke and Latham claim that creating a specific, difficult learning goal in this type of situation facilitates meta-cognition which is particularly helpful in complex environments with limited guidance, such as in an MBA program. Organizational outcomes Goal orientation has also been linked URLanizational outcomes, specifically job performance. Payne et al. found that individuals with high levels of trait and state LGO and low levels of trait APGO had better job performance, that PPGO was unrelated to performance, and that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond both cognitive ability and the Big Five personality characteristics. Their findings suggest that LGO is a valuable predictor of job performance and it may be in the best interest URLanizations to create a climate in which learning is valued over performance.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Conceptual and empirical work by Elliot and Church and VandeWalle demonstrated that the factor structure of goal orientation lends itself to three distinct dimensions as summarized below .Elliot, A.

{"doc_id":29305513.0,"context":"Legacy of nationalization of history Nation mythologies, histories and states An ancient Finnish Hero Illustration from Kalevala One of the most important consequences of printed texts of nationalized history was that it provided a basis for national revivals in the process of creating modern nations. Projects of national awakenings captured nationalized history and turned it into a weapon of popularization of national myths in the period of establishing history as a social scientific discipline. A shortcut to production of national mythologies that proves ancient origins of modern nations, providing them with a respectable past, was URLery of historical documents, literature and historical works that were lost for some time, and then suddenly rediscovered to the approval of an astonished grateful public. Authors of such rediscovered treasures that were in a quest for success and glory did not suspect that they were in fact builders of as yet nonexistent modern nations. Even when it was obvious that certain texts were basically invented national myths, many social groups, and even intellectuals, wanted to believe that they were authentic national epics, like the Kalevala in Finland. The nationalization of history, which had its origins more in the epics and tendentious oratory than in philosophy, sometimes grew the idea of an esprit des peuples or national spirit , and , later still , the idea that each nation had a 'mission'. Such ideas did not evolve into groups of associated individuals, but into universal spirits that is said to be able to destroy individuals and nations. Nationalization of history was an important element of national revival and creating new nation states in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. New nation states and their institutions had the most important role in social process of the professionalization and institutionalization of history that was additionally supporting the process of nationalization of history. The final consequence was that national history regarded the nation-state as the primary unit of historical analysis. Society and nature 250px|State entities on the former territory of Yugoslavia, 2008. Nationalization of history affects all aspects of life, from relationships with other nationalities to architecture. This is a result of the fact that nationalization of history corresponds with nationalization of nature , and the fact that reservations and hostilities toward other nations accompanied nationalism from the beginning. At the end of the 20th century there were extreme nationalistic interpretations of Balkan and Caucasus history, which became powerful weapons in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.Pakier, Strth; p. 39, \"In the Balkan and Caucasian parts of Europe, history in extreme nationalistic interpretations developed into powerful weapon in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multi-national states like Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.\" After disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, besides the process of renationalization of history, there is sometimes also retroactive nationalization of victims or tragedies of the people that in past lived in those states. According to new national historical narratives, the reason for some people were the victims of certain tragedies was because they were of a certain nationality, for example the Ukrainians of the Soviet Union.Zhurzhenko, The geopolitics of memory, \" An important consequence of the delegitimization of the Soviet historical narrative and the (re-)construction of national histories after 1991 is the retroactive nationalization of victims.... According to the new national historical narrative, they were killed by the Soviet regime because they were Ukrainians  \" Nationalist discourse in Croatia presents the aftermath of Bleiburg repatriations as an event where only Croatians suffered and died just because they were Croatians , eluding the fact that many of the victims were Serbs, Montenegrins or Slovenians while many Croatians had died while fighting as collaborators against Yugoslav partisans. Denationalization of history Nationalization of history has been increasingly called into question, and one of its consequences is the emerging of processes of denationalization of history, which is the result of an intention to change the perspective of creating works about history by promoting pluralism and international standards in social sciences. In Central and Eastern Europe there are tensions between nationalization of history and the process of European integrations. That is one of reasons URLanized activities aimed toward denationalization of history. In cases when history was reinterpreted and filtered by the media and official orthodoxy  there is a situation in which  nationalization of history leads to its denial.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Nationalization of history affects all aspects of life, from relationships with other nationalities to architecture.","after_edit":" The nationalization of history affects all aspects of life, from relationships with other nationalities to architecture.","start_sent_pos":2185,"end_sent_pos":2302,"raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","clarity"],"label":"fluency"}

However, when applied to zero-shot cross-lingual transfer tasks, most existing methods use only single-language input for LM finetuning, without leveraging the intrinsic cross-lingual alignment between different languages that is essential for multilingual tasks. In this paper, we propose FILTER, an enhanced fusion method that takes cross-lingual data as input for XLM finetuning. Specifically, FILTER first encodes text input in the source language and its translation in the target language independently in the shallow layers, then performs cross-lingual fusion to extract multilingual knowledge in the intermediate layers, and finally performs further language-specific encoding. During inference, the model makes predictions based on the text input in the target language and its translation in the source language. For simple tasks such as classification, translated text in the target language shares the same label as the source language. However, this shared label becomes less accurate or even unavailable for more complex tasks such as question answering, NER and POS tagging. For better model scalability , we further propose an additional KL-divergence self-teaching loss for model training, based on auto-generated soft pseudo-labels for translated text in the target language.

The slender design of the tube which contained the rocket's payload  was very narrow and long, limiting what objects could be inserted into the tube. This limitation on size was extremely inconvenient when considering the future proposed payloads of Martlet rockets which included satellites and space probes. The cannon-like design also eliminated the capacity for crewed space travel as well as the launching of satellites carrying extremely sensitive scientific instruments and payloads due to the extreme acceleration placed on the projectile during firing. Martlet 2A, 2B, 2C family The Martlet 2A, 2B, and 2C represented the earliest of the Martlet 2 16-inch (406mm) test projectiles. Marlet 2A was designed simultaneously with the Martlet 1 with a range of interest being 70 to 200 kilometers. Most carried multi-type research payloads studying the upper atmosphere and near-space conditions. Due to their low cost per missile launch, they were used to test out single payloads. Despite similarities in missile air frame , the Martlet 2A, 2B, and 2C featured differences in their structural materials and mechanical details. For the Martlet 2A, the liquid payload was loaded into an aluminum, tapered liner inside the missile body.

South Africa environment minister announced long-awaited restrictions on lion hunting, declaring he was sickened by wealthy tourists shooting tame lions from the back of a truck and felling rhinos with a bow and arrow. This comes in response to the imbroglio created over the potential canned hunt of the African rhinoceros 'Baixinha.' Dismissing threats of legal action by the hunting industry, Marthinus Van Schalkwyk said the new law would ban \"canned\" hunting of big predators and rhinos in small enclosures that offer them no means of escape. In addition, lions bred in captivity would have to be released into the open for at least two years before they could be hunted. Van Schalkwyk said a previously proposed six-month delay would not give lions enough time to develop self-defence instincts. \"Hunting should be about fair chase ... testing the wits of a hunter against that of the animal,\" he told a press conference. \"Over the years that got eroded and now we are trying to re-establish that principle.\" This measure was later overturned. In May 2007 a much-reported hunting trip involved the killing of 1,051pound pet pig in an alleged canned hunt. The pig was named \"Monster Pig\" by the media and it was believed that the pig was a feral hog . It was soon discovered that the pig, previously named \"Fred , \"  had been someone's pet and was then sold to a hunting facility only a brief time before he was killed. On May 3, paying customers Mike Stone and his 11-year-old son , Jamison , hunted him in a fenced enclosure. Jamison shot Fred a total of eight times over a period of three hours. A June 2007 story on CNN detailed canned hunting in South Africa and includes a video of a canned lion hunt where the animal is shot against a fence. On November 30, 2014, CBS  60 Minutes broadcast a story (\"The Lion Whisperer\") about one man's sanctuary in South Africa for 26 lions, raised in captivity, who he rescued from the fate of canned lion hunting. In November 2015, the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa (PHASA) voted to disassociate itself from the practice of canned lion hunting in South Africa. Unless the conservation value of canned lion hunting is demonstrated to PHASA, URLanization will remain against the practice and, under penalty of expulsion, no PHASA members will be permitted to participate canned lion hunts. In November 2017  PHASA came under fire over the body's reversal of its 2015 policy against the hunting of captive-bred lions.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" On May 3, paying customers Mike Stone and his 11-year-old son , Jamison , hunted him in a fenced enclosure.","after_edit":" On May 3, paying customers Mike Stone and his 11-year-old son Jamison hunted the pig in a fenced enclosure.","start_sent_pos":2310,"end_sent_pos":2418,"raw_intents":["clarity","meaning-changed","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

The second group of needs is those of relatedness the desire people have for maintaining important interpersonal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs: an intrinsic desire for personal development. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization. Alderfer categorized the lower order needs (Physiological and Safety) into the Existence category. He fit Maslow's interpersonal love and esteem needs into the Relatedness category.

Samples have been found to contain the designer drug U-47700, heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil . It is taken by injection, smoking, snorting, or oral ingestion. It was first discovered in the United States and was thought to be a unique chemical compound before being identified as a mixture of drugs. In addition to containing powerful opioids, what makes gray death an extremely dangerous drug is the fact that the constituent drugs' identities, their overall ratios in the product, and their uneven distribution within the productare completely unknown to the user. This means that the user cannot predict what dose to safely take; even two identical doses by mass may contain more or less of an unknown substance due to uneven physical distribution, as seen with heroin and fentanyl mixes. Opioid addicts tend to be more susceptible to the drug . They may think they are buying heroin, unaware that it is actually gray death. Reversing a gray death overdose frequently requires multiple doses of naloxone , whereas a typical overdose of heroin (which is much less potent) typically needs only one dose. This is consistent with the difficulty of overdose reversal seen with high-affinity opioids in the fentanyl chemical family or with buprenorphine. The greater affinity of these substances for the -opioid receptor causes less naloxoneto bind to receptors, increasing the dosage necessary to counteract the resulting respiratory depression. The difficulty in reversing an overdose of gray death is likely due to the presence of a fentanyl analogue, which reporting seems to corroborate as of December 2018.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" They may think they are buying heroin, unaware that it is actually gray death.","after_edit":" As such, even experienced opioid users risk serious injury or death when taking this drug mixture.","start_sent_pos":926,"end_sent_pos":1005,"raw_intents":["meaning-changed","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}
{"doc_id":172474.0,"context":"Exercise and lactate During power exercises such as sprinting, when the rate of demand for energy is high, glucose is broken down and oxidized to pyruvate , and lactate is then produced from the pyruvate faster than the body can process it, causing lactate concentrations to rise.  The production of lactate is beneficial for NAD+ regeneration (pyruvate is reduced to lactate while NADH is oxidized to NAD+), which is used up in oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate during production of pyruvate from glucose, and this ensures that energy production is maintained and exercise can continue. During intense exercise, the respiratory chain cannot keep up with the amount of hydrogen ions that join to form NADH, and cannot regenerate NAD+ quickly enough. However, lactate is continually formed at rest and during all exercise intensities. With the use of stable isotopic tracers URLe Brooks and colleagues, at the University of California, Berkeley, observed that lactate served as a metabolic fuel being produced and oxidatively disposed in resting and exercising muscle. Some causes of this are metabolism in red blood cells that lack mitochondria, and limitations resulting from the enzyme activity that occurs in muscle fibers having high glycolytic capacity. In 2004, Robergs et al. maintained that lactic acidosis during exercise is a \"construct\" or myth, pointing out that part of the H+ comes from ATP hydrolysis (ATP4 + H2O ADP3 + + H+), and that reducing pyruvate to lactate (pyruvate + NADH + H+ lactate + NAD+) actually consumes H+. Lindinger et al. countered that they had ignored the causative factors of the increase in [H+]. After all, the production of lactate from a neutral molecule must increase [H+] to maintain electroneutrality. The point of Robergs's paper, however, was that lactate is produced from pyruvate, which has the same charge. It is pyruvate production from neutral glucose that generates H+: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Subsequent lactate production absorbs these protons: 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH 2 + 2NAD+ Overall: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O 2 + 2NAD+ + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Although the reaction glucose 2lactate + 2H+ releases two H+ when viewed on its own, the H+ are absorbed in the production of ATP.

{"doc_id":25893514.0,"context":"When breast cancer is surgically excised, it can come back (local recurrence) in the remaining breast or on the chest wall in a small proportion of women. Adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary if breast cancer is treated by removing only the cancerous lump with a rim of surrounding normal tissue, as it reduces the chance of local recurrence significantly . When cancer does come back, it most commonly occurs in the tissues surrounding the original cancer (the tumour bed), even though there are multicentric cancers in remote areas of the breast. This suggests that it is most important to treat the tumour bed. The rationale for TARGIT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the tumour bed. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumour have been time tested and proven to be effective. EBRT is usually given as a course of whole breast radiotherapy and an additional tumour bed boost  . However, it has a few drawbacks; for example, the tumour bed where the boost dose should be applied can be missed (\"geographical miss\") due to the difficulties in localization of the complex wound cavity  even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay (\"temporal miss\") between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumour cells  . These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumour cells. Furthermore, TARGIT inhibits the stimulating effects of wound fluid on cancer cells, suggesting for the first time, a beneficial effect of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) on tumour microenvironment. In these studies, women treated with  TARGIT-IORT  during lumpectomy for breast cancer combined with whole breast radiotherapy had a significantly low mortality from non-breast-cancer causes, such as cardiovascular and lung complications, as well as other cancers compared with those who received whole breast radiotherapy. Therefore, this reduction was thought to be due to the delivery of TARGIT-IORT to the fresh tumour bed during the trauma of surgery rather than avoidance of scattered radiation from whole breast radiotherapy .","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumour cells.","after_edit":" These potentially harmful effects may be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumour cells.","start_sent_pos":1373,"end_sent_pos":1550,"raw_intents":["clarity","coherence","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

By the 18th century, many Indians in the north of the subcontinent had a \"native speaker's competence in Persian\".Faruqi, Shamsur Rahman (2003), \"A Long History of Urdu Literarature, Part 1\", in Pollock (ed.), Literary cultures in history: reconstructions from South Asia, p. 849, Decline Following Aurangzeb's death, Persian began to fall into decline, being displaced by Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu). The arrival and strengthening of British political power added a growing influence of English as well. However, for a long time Persian was still the dominant language of the subcontinent, used in education, Muslim rule, the judiciary, and literature. The East India Company acknowledged Persian as a \"language of command\", necessary to communicate with and control the Indian population. Hence many British officials arriving in India learned Persian in colleges established by the Company. The teachers in these colleges were often Indian. In some cases, Britishers even took over as Persian professors, sidelining the role of the Indians. Deccan A Persian poem produced in the Deccan. 17th century.|346x346px Although considerably distanced from North India, the Deccan was also a recipient of Persian's linguistic impact. Persianate culture was brought to the Deccan fleetingly through the efforts of the Delhi Sultanate in the early 14th century. Persian finally gained a foothold in the region with the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate in 1347, which used the language for official purposes. The dynasty had a great interest in Persian culture, and several members were proficient in the language, producing their own literature. Literati from Northern India found themselves welcome at the court, and scholars from Iran were invited as well. Madrasas were built over the expanse of the kingdom, most notably the Mahmud Gawan Madrasa at Bidar, where Persian was taught.  In spite of this, Persian did not achieve the linguistic penetration it had in the north of the subcontinent. Richard Eaton writes that Persian was much less widely understood in the  region than vernacular languages  . During the turn of the 16th century, the Bahmani Sultanate splintered into the Deccan Sultanates, which were also Persianate in culture. They used Persian as a courtly language, as well as for official and administrative purposes. The language received literary patronage  . However, the sultans simultaneously promoted regional languages such as Telugu, Marathi, and Deccani (the southern variety of Hindustani), at times even using them in administration.  The reign of the Deccan Sultanates lasted until the late 17th century, when Aurangzeb brought the region into the Mughal Empire and established Aurangabad as the Deccan's capital. As was Mughal practice, Persian was used in many levels of administration. Major cities of this region that served as centres of Persian patronage included Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda. Notable Persian literature produced includes Futuh-us-Salatin, and the Bahmannamh . Influence on Indic languages As a prestige language and lingua franca over a period of 800 years in the Indian subcontinent, Classical Persian exerted a vast influence over numerous Indic languages. Generally speaking, the degree of impact is seen to increase the more one moves towards the north-west of the subcontinent, i.e. the Indo-Iranian frontier. For example, the Indo-Aryan languages have the most impact from Persian; this ranges from a high appearance in Punjabi, Sindhi, Kashmiri, and Gujarati, to more moderate representation in Bengali and Marathi. The largest foreign element in the Indo-Aryan languages is Persian. Conversely, the Dravidian languages have seen a low level of influence from Persian.

Some colleges and universities in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh offer Persian as a course of study.  Though Arabic largely dominates the realm of Islamic liturgy and theology in the Indian subcontinent, Persian can also be seen in some religious spheres: the dhikr sessions of Sufism often employ Persian poetry in song, and the Sufi devotional music genre of qawwali also uses Persian in parallel with local languages. Famed qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan sang sometimes in Persian.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Madrasas were built over the expanse of the kingdom, most notably the Mahmud Gawan Madrasa at Bidar, where Persian was taught.","after_edit":" Madrasas were built over the expanse of the kingdom, such as the the Mahmud Gawan Madrasa at Bidar, where Persian was taught.","start_sent_pos":1888,"end_sent_pos":2015,"raw_intents":["clarity","style","others"],"label":"clarity"}

The region served both as the fertile ground of a major civilisation and as the gateway of South Asia to Central Asia and the Near East. Quote: \"Numerous passageways through the western frontiers of the Indian subcontinent in modern Pakistan and Afghanistan served as migration routes to South Asia from the Iranian plateau and the Central Asian steppes. Prehistoric and protohistoric exchanges across the Hindu Kush, Karakoram, and Himalaya ranges demonstrate earlier precedents for routes through the high mountain passes and river valleys in later historical periods. Typological similarities between Northern Neolithic sites in Kashmir and Swat and sites in the Tibetan plateau and northern China show that 'Mountain chains have often integrated rather than isolated peoples.' Ties between the trading post of Shortughai in Badakhshan (northeastern Afghanistan) and the lower Indus valley provide evidence for long-distance commercial networks and 'polymorphous relations' across the Hindu Kush until c. 1800 B.C.' The Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Complex (BMAC) may have functioned as a 'filter' for the introduction of Indo-Iranian languages to the northwestern Indian subcontinent, although routes and chronologies remain hypothetical.

The casings survived , but the propellant failed at . This was solved for later rockets by filling the propellant cavity with liquid, but only after development of the 3B model had ended. Martlet 3E The Martlet 3E was a suborbital solid rocket designed to be fired from a smaller, 7-inch (180mm) cannon used in the HARP project. Its basic concept revolved around packaging the rocket grain in a case with elastic properties to transmit the lateral strain to the gun tube. The 3E model utilized a new technique of rocket grain construction  that consisted of laminating sheet double-base propellant grain under hydraulic pressure. Martlet 4 By July 1964, the Marlet 4 program pursued the development of an orbit capable multi-stage rocket system to be launched from the 16\" Barbados gun. Two versions of full-scale orbital launch vehicle projectiles were proposed in the Martlet 4 series. The first was to have used three solid rocket motor stages and was planned to orbit approximately 50 pounds of payload. The second used liquid rocket motors and was planned to have orbited 200 pounds of payload. Both were about long and in diameter, weighing about at launch. However, no Martlet 4 vehicles were built; the project was halted before the design was completed. Martlet 4 Control Systems A guidance and control system was developed for the orbital mission by Aviation Electric Limited of Montreal under the direction of McGill-BRL-Harry Diamond Laboratory group. Infrared horizon sensors and sun sensors were included to calculate vehicle attitude. Information for on-board sensors was to be processed by the logic module  which provided commands to a cold gas thruster system which in turn adjusted the orientation of the vehicle . The components of the guidance and control assembly were integrated into a 6.25 inch diameter test projectile.

The main gate of the Nyumba ya Sanaa cultural centre in Dar es Salaam has decorations by Lilanga URLe Lilanga (right) and fellow painter Patrick Francis Imanjama outside Nyumba ya Sanaa In 1970, Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures and practising contemporary art. In 1971, he found his first employment, thanks to his uncle, Augustino Malaba, an already well-known sculptor, who would be his future collaborator. He worked as a night guard at the House of Art (Nyumba ya Sanaa), a  centre for the development of African art and craftsmanship in Dar es Salaam. Lilanga's talents were soon recognized by Jean Pruitt, an American aid worker promoting Tanzanian art. Lilanga welcomed  other artists like Robino Ntila, Augustino Malaba and Patrick Francis Imanjama to join Nyumba ya Sanaa . He also began to create paintings on batik cloth, on goatskin and on metal sheets for the finishing of railings and gates of the centre.  In 1977, he made his first journey outside Africa, travelling to New York, where he had a show at the Maryknoll Sisters Ossining Center . He stayed for a brief time in Manhattan, selling prints made on paper or cardboard, standing on street corners. Artistic development & success Shortly after beginning grammar school, Lilanga had his first contact with sculpture ( roots, softwood and, later, hard ebony), working in the Makonde tradition. He dedicated himself almost exclusively to this technique from 1961 until 1972. He showed his first works to Europeans who worked in the refugee camps during Mozambique's war of independence. Following their advice, in 1970 Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures. A lot of URLe Lilanga's lifetime art works can be found in leading international collections like The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi or the Hamburg Mawingu Collection HMC of German collector Peter-Andreas Kamphausen. Directly after the death of the artist, the HMC: URLe Lilanga Collection presented the first systematically and thematically complete catalogue of Lilanga's work. In addition, the book explores the traditional roots of East African Makonde art, as well as four decades of Lilanga's artistic development with different materials and techniques, including sculpture, paintings, etchings, drawings and metal works. Currently the HMC publish the URLe Lilanga News as an online blog with information about the artist, his art works, exhibitions and other interesting background material. Also in 2005, the African Collection series (Skira Editore, Milan) published a well-illustrated book on Lilanga's work with useful information.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Artistic development & success Shortly after beginning grammar school, Lilanga had his first contact with sculpture ( roots, softwood and, later, hard ebony), working in the Makonde tradition.","after_edit":" Artistic development & success Shortly after beginning grammar school, Lilanga had his first contact with wooden sculpture, made from roots, softwood and, later, hard ebony), working in the Makonde tradition.","start_sent_pos":1495,"end_sent_pos":1688,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","others"],"label":"clarity"}

{"doc_id":29326123.0,"context":"Research has examined goal orientation as a motivation variable that is useful for recruitment, climate and culture, performance appraisal, and choice.DeGeest, D., & Brown, K. G. (2011). The role of goal orientation in leadership development. Human Resource Development Quarterly, 22(2), 157-175. Studies have also used goal orientation to predict sales performance, adaptive performanceStasielowicz, L. (2019). Goal orientation and performance adaptation: A meta-analysis. Journal of Research in Personality, 82., goal setting, learning and adaptive behaviors in training, and leadership. Historical perspective Dweck proposed that there are two types of goal orientation: learning orientation and performance orientation.Dweck, C.S. (1986). Motivational processes affecting learning. American Psychologist, 41, 1040-1048. Dweck postulated that children with learning goals were believed to approach situations to master the acquisition of new skills, while children with performance goals were believed to approach situations to gain approval from peers and teachers. Like Eison, Dweck conceptualized goal orientation as a two-dimension construct. Individuals with a learning goal orientation (sometimes referred to as mastery goal orientation; abbreviated as LGO) seek to develop their competence by acquiring new skills and mastering new situations. They are not concerned about their performance relative to others, but rather with furthering their understanding of a given topic or task.Hendricks, J.W., & Payne, S.C. (2007). Beyond the Big Five: Leader goal orientation as a predictor of leadership effectiveness. Human Performance, 20, 317-343. Individuals with a performance goal orientation seek to demonstrate and validate the adequacy of their competence to receive favorable compliments while avoiding negative judgments. Although Dweck's work in this area built on the foundation laid by Nicholls, the fundamental difference between the two scholars' works was the attribution of an individual's goal orientation: Nicholls believed that the goal orientation held by an individual was a result of the possession of either an internal or external referent, while Dweck considered the adoption of a particular goal orientation to be related to the theory of intelligence held by that individual. Subsequent work by Eison and colleagues in 1982 led to a change in the conceptualization of these orientations from two ends of a continuum to two separate constructs.Eison, J.A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1982). LOGO II: A user's manual. Knoxville: University of Tennessee, Learning Research Center. More recently, researchers have embraced the idea that individuals can adopt the two orientation styles simultaneously: persons can be independently high or low in learning and performance orientations. Ultimately, individuals can entertain multiple competing goal orientations at the same time, and strive to both outperform competitors and improve their performance. This line of thinking led to the conceptualization of two separate continua: one for learning goal orientation and one for performance goal orientation.Eison, J. A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1986). Educational and personal characteristics of four different types of learning- and grade-oriented students. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 11, 5467. State versus trait There has been great debate as to whether goal orientation should be operationalized as a state or as a trait. Throughout the goal orientation literature, there are inconsistencies about the conceptualization of the stability of the construct. For example, DeShon & Gillespie stated that in the literature, DeShon, R. P., & Gillespie, J. Z. (2005). A motivated action theory account of goal orientation. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(6), 1096-1127. goal orientation has been conceptualized as a trait, quasi-trait, and state. They states that whether researchers conceptualize goal orientation as a trait or a state \"depends on the breadth of the inference that the researcher is attempting to support\". State goal orientation refers to the goal one has in a particular situation . It is similar to trait goal orientation in that it represents one's preference in an achievement situation. Button, Mathieu, & Zajac take an integrative view of the construct,Button, S. B., Mathieu, J. E., & Zajac, D. M. (1996, July). Goal orientation URLanizational research: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 67(1), 26-48. stating that goal orientation is best categorized as a relatively stable individual difference variable that can be influenced by situational and contextual characteristics. They found that when few situational cues are present, individuals will adopt their dispositional goal orientations. However, when \"dispositional goal orientations predispose individuals to adopt particular response patterns across situations, situational characteristics may cause them to adopt a different or less acute response pattern for a specific situation\". Therefore, trait and state goal orientations interact, and both should be considered simultaneously. Types Since the realization that performance goal orientation is most effectively split into two separate parts, researchers have conducted validation studies to demonstrate the statistical and conceptual distinction of three dimensions to goal orientation. Conceptual and empirical work by Elliot and Church and VandeWalle demonstrated that the factor structure of goal orientation lends itself to three distinct dimensions as summarized below .Elliot, A. J. Church, M. A. (1997). A hierarchical model of approach and avoidance achievement motivation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, 218-232. An explanation of the learning-approach and learning-avoidance goal orientations are also included for completeness. Antecedents Throughout the goal orientation literature, many studies have examined relationships between goal orientation and various antecedents. These antecedents have been identified to have varying levels of importance. In a meta-analysis by Payne et al., both the need for achievement and the Big Five personality traits were identified as important antecedents of goal orientation, while cognitive ability was found to have almost no relationship with goal orientation. The following sections go into more detail about each antecedent. Payne and her colleagues did not distinguish between proximal and distal antecedents. Another factor to consider when examining the relationship between goal orientation and goal setting is the level of inherent complexity in the situation or task. In situations with more complex tasks, it appears that \"do your best\" goals may lead to higher performance than specific goals. It is possible that in complex tasks, a specific, difficult goal imposes greater cognitive demands on employees, making it difficult for them to learn the complex task due to this increased pressure.Latham, G.P & Seijts, G.H.

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century.","after_edit":" Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series produced by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century.","start_sent_pos":782,"end_sent_pos":1014,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

The Martlet 2G-1 was a proposed space launch vehicle variant of Martlet 2G, which had a solid rocket motor in the projectile.

They were built and tested for the HARP project but were ultimately not successful due to restrictions in funding and a severe lack of technical information regarding the behavior of large rocket grains  under high acceleration loading. When testing these projectiles, the danger of in-bore detonation was considered a very serious potential problem. Martlet 3A The Martlet 3A was an diameter, gun-fired rocket projectile that theoretically was able to reach 500km altitude.

A standard 6-inch rocket was bonded to an aluminum case , and the rocket nozzle was supported by a pusher plate, which would impart the acceleration thrust to the missile through the aluminum wall casing. Fiberglass limited acceleration to 3600g (corresponding to a velocity of at rocket ignition). The Martlet 3A's original objective was to carry a 40-lbs payload to an altitude of 500km, which theoretically was feasible if the system could be launched at full gun pressures.

This fact, and other linguistic considerations, have led experts to believe that Digor dialect became separated from Proto-Ossetian during the Mongol conquests. In \"Ashkharatsuyts\" Ashtigors are given separately from Alans - the ancestors of present-day Ossetians. Also starting from the 18th century  the ethnonym digor is widely used by travelers and in Russian official documents. Based on these facts, Ossetian Soviet linguist-Iranist Vasily Abaev suppose that the Digors could be an iranized Circassian tribe and the first part of the name - dig- can have the same roots with the Circassian endonym Adyge and -or can be just a prefix for plurality as in many contemporary Caucasian languages. Digors make the majority of the Ossetians in Digoria - the western part of the North OssetiaAlania (Digorsky and Irafsky districts) and in Kabardino-Balkaria. In the beginning of the 19th century some families from Digoria resettled in Mozdoksky District and there are 2 large settlements of them.

{"doc_id":1115806.0,"context":"ERG theory is a theory in psychology proposed by Clayton Alderfer. thumb Alderfer further developed Maslow's hierarchy of needs by categorizing the hierarchy into his ERG theory (Existence, Relatedness and Growth). The existence group is concerned with  providing the basic material existence requirements of humans. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs is those of relatedness the desire people have for maintaining important interpersonal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs: an intrinsic desire for personal development. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization. Alderfer categorized the lower order needs (Physiological and Safety) into the Existence category. He fit Maslow's interpersonal love and esteem needs into the Relatedness category. The Growth category contained the self-actualization and self-esteem needs  . Alderfer also proposed a  regression theory to go along with the ERG theory .

{"doc_id":55503854.0,"context":"Relation to traditional epistemology Traditional epistemology and Bayesian epistemology are both forms of epistemology, but they differ in various respects, for example, concerning their methodology, the propositional attitudes they study , the role justification or confirmation plays in them and some of their research interests. Bayesian epistemology focuses on degrees of belief, also often called credences. On the other hand, Traditional epistemology focuses on knowledge, analyzed by Plato as being justified true beliefs . They then seek to understand what counts as knowledgeand how to evaluate one's beliefs (see foundationalism, coherentism, and the problem of philosophical skepticism or the question of whether knowledge is possible at all ) . Bayesian epistemology, on the other hand, works by formalizing concepts and problems, which are often vague in the traditional approach. It thereby focuses more on mathematical intuitions and promises a higher degree of precision. It sees belief as a continuous phenomenon that comes in various degrees, so-called credences. Some Bayesians have even suggested that the regular notion of belief should be abandoned. But there are also proposals to connect the two, for example, the Lockean thesis, which defines belief as credence above a certain threshold. Justification plays a central role in traditional epistemology while Bayesians have focused on the related notions of confirmation and disconfirmation through evidence. The notion of evidence is important for both approaches but only the traditional approach has been interested in studying the sources of evidence, like perception and memory. Bayesianism, on the other hand, has focused on the role of evidence for rationality: how someone's credence should be adjusted upon receiving new evidence. There is an analogy between the Bayesian norms of rationality in terms of probabilistic laws and the traditional norms of rationality in terms of deductive consistency. Certain traditional problems, like the topic of skepticism about our knowledge of the external world, are difficult to express in Bayesian terms.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Bayesian epistemology focuses on degrees of belief, also often called credences.","after_edit":" Traditional epistemology focuses on degrees of belief, also often called credences.","start_sent_pos":331,"end_sent_pos":412,"raw_intents":["meaning-changed","style","meaning-changed"],"label":"meaning-changed"}

He worked as a night guard at the House of Art (Nyumba ya Sanaa), a  centre for the development of African art and craftsmanship in Dar es Salaam. Lilanga's talents were soon recognized by Jean Pruitt, an American aid worker promoting Tanzanian art. Lilanga welcomed  other artists like Robino Ntila, Augustino Malaba and Patrick Francis Imanjama to join Nyumba ya Sanaa . He also began to create paintings on batik cloth, on goatskin and on metal sheets for the finishing of railings and gates of the centre.  In 1977, he made his first journey outside Africa, travelling to New York, where he had a show at the Maryknoll Sisters Ossining Center . He stayed for a brief time in Manhattan, selling prints made on paper or cardboard, standing on street corners. Artistic development & success Shortly after beginning grammar school, Lilanga had his first contact with sculpture ( roots, softwood and, later, hard ebony), working in the Makonde tradition. He dedicated himself almost exclusively to this technique from 1961 until 1972. He showed his first works to Europeans who worked in the refugee camps during Mozambique's war of independence. Following their advice, in 1970 Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures. A lot of URLe Lilanga's lifetime art works can be found in leading international collections like The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi or the Hamburg Mawingu Collection HMC of German collector Peter-Andreas Kamphausen. Directly after the death of the artist, the HMC: URLe Lilanga Collection presented the first systematically and thematically complete catalogue of Lilanga's work. In addition, the book explores the traditional roots of East African Makonde art, as well as four decades of Lilanga's artistic development with different materials and techniques, including sculpture, paintings, etchings, drawings and metal works. Currently the HMC publish the URLe Lilanga News as an online blog with information about the artist, his art works, exhibitions and other interesting background material. Also in 2005, the African Collection series (Skira Editore, Milan) published a well-illustrated book on Lilanga's work with useful information.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" The main gate of the Nyumba ya Sanaa cultural centre in Dar es Salaam has decorations by Lilanga URLe Lilanga (right) and fellow painter Patrick Francis Imanjama outside Nyumba ya Sanaa In 1970, Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures and practising contemporary art.","after_edit":" The main gate of the Nyumba ya Sanaa cultural centre in Dar es Salaam with sculptures by Lilanga URLe Lilanga (right) and fellow painter Patrick Francis Imanjama outside Nyumba ya Sanaa In 1970, Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures and practising contemporary art.","start_sent_pos":253,"end_sent_pos":585,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}
{"doc_id":50178403.0,"context":"Green hunting (  eco-hunting, green bullet concept, green darting , darting safari) is the practice of hunting game animals with tranquilizer dart guns or bows and the subsequent release of the live animals . Green hunting would typically be performed when tranquilization of the animal is necessary for veterinary, monitoring , or translocation purposes. Green hunting has been advocated as a conservation-minded alternative to destructive sport hunting, because it allows the hunter to experience the thrill of a traditional hunt without killing the animal, leaving the wildlife abundance undiminished and  contributing directly to conservation initiatives. The measurements and details of a tranquilized animal are accepted in URLanization's record books and fiberglass replicas can be made for the hunter. There are some  advantages of eco-hunting . The hunter may have the additional option to be kept regularly updated on the animal's future movements if the darting was part of a GPS collaring project. Though still costly (sometimes upwards of $25,000 USD), green hunting is more economical as fees are lower than trophy hunting (up to $ 60,000 USD). The fees finance the conservation project that necessitates an immobilized animal for micro-chipping , ear-notching, tissue collection or GPS tracking and any additional funds can be used to support the management of the protected area involved. The hunter must get within 30 meters from the animal to successfully dart it, often much closer than required for traditional hunting. Group darting safaris also exist, where a group witnesses the work, without participating in the procedures.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Green hunting has been advocated as a conservation-minded alternative to destructive sport hunting, because it allows the hunter to experience the thrill of a traditional hunt without killing the animal, leaving the wildlife abundance undiminished and  contributing directly to conservation initiatives.","after_edit":" Green hunting has been advocated as a conservation-minded alternative to destructive sport hunting, because it allows the hunter to experience the thrill of a traditional hunt without killing the animal, leaving the wildlife abundance undiminished and thus contributing directly to conservation initiatives.","start_sent_pos":355,"end_sent_pos":659,"raw_intents":["meaning-changed","coherence","coherence"],"label":"coherence"}

They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States . Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland . Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. Wlastkw means \"Beautiful River.\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. Wlastkwewiyik means \"People of the Beautiful River,\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007. Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years.

{"doc_id":105134.0,"context":"240px| Several companies just looked the vision of WiMAX but ignore its threats. In the picture is MTube, innovated by Science and Technology Advisory Group of Executive Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Computers and technology bring several conveniences to the modern lifestyle , but it creates risks like computer viruses and hacking. Many people want to enjoy the conveniences brought by new technology, but they may not be aware of its problems. WiMAX , which is a communication standard is mainly promoted by the Taipei Computer Association, in addition to the Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China , is considered by some to be the next generation in mobile devices. Since several Internet crimes are progressively respected by several information security companies , some of them disputed on security of WiMAX. After all, everyone wants to welcome this new technology but is afraid of its problem to bring about security issues. Although some (security) companies analyzed statistics on potential issues to dispute the future of WiMAX, but the question is how will they present their analysis? With opportunities from  two press conferences in Taiwan, Wikinews Journalist Rico Shen briefly and successively interviewed Hsiao-wen Hung, President of Microsoft Research Asia and Li Chang, Deputy Secretary General of Taipei Computer Association. With their experiences in the IT industry, they agreed to comment on this question. __NOTOC__ Hsiao-wen Hung: Information security isn't built within a day . Hsiao-wen Hung: The information security industry isn't built within a simple solution. (Interview audio clip) The improvements of information technology firmly brought on  opportunities, but information security is particularly respected by companies from security industry, As of this , how about the information security? Prior to the  (Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Server 2008) launch, although WiMAX, a next-generation networking technology, will bring on the growth of mobile users, but its future was ever disputed by some companies from information security industry. Hung: Safety and flexibility , its relation is like a paddle . If something wanted to be linkable anywhere, there were still some considerations on security . It's like a house which anyone can enter in it . If you want to ensure its safety on your house, you should doseveral hard works . That's why the security is a must-have trend in reality. As of information securitywhat you mentioned about before , relatively, if a newly-proposed future technology wasn't normally populated, it's a golden opportunity for companies when some security companies properly disputed on its future. Hung: Even though it's safe to lock everything all, but it is inconvenience to lock (them all) . Therefore, some key elements like encryption, password authentication, policy, and some Web 2.0 solutions played key roles in information security. There were some involuntary and deliberate attackers on the Internet , if anyone want to prevent them, a complete planning should do priory . That's why the information security industry is built with several solutions and long-term experiences but not a simple solution in a day. Li Chang: Convergences will be brought for security and IT industries . Li Chang: Convergences will be brought for security and IT industries besides of changes on WiMAX. (Interview audio clip) What's your opinion on several disputes from IS companies during the \"2008 Asia-pacific Information Security Forum\"? Chang: Our member companies will do attempts on trend-changing. As of our board committee, because (our member) companies mostly manufactured notebook computers, if a common consensus from several senior officers from IT industrywill be established , I think the objects of TCA will be more and more cleared . What's your opinion on Hsiao-wen Hung's word, \"When people want to enjoy a new technology, some protections should be necessity \"? Chang: It's an undoubted truth. When a new technology was under development, companies mostly looked on its vision rather than its hidden factors like information or data security. As the Internet just began in a mature infrastructure, the public might not know its critical issue on security factor. As of WiMAX which you mentioned, even though it's under development, but you will not imagine what it will happen in the future.

These LMsrequire expensive computing resources for self-supervised or un-supervised learning from huge unlabelled text corpora. The information learned is transferred through so-called embeddings to downstream prediction tasks. Bioinformatics provide vast gold-mines of structured and sequentially ordered text data leading to extraordinarily successful protein sequence LMs that promise new frontiers for generative and predictive tasks at low inference cost . Here, we addressed two questions: (1) To which extent can HPC up-scale protein LMs to larger databases and larger models? (2) To which extent can LMs extract features from single proteins to get closer to the performance of methods using evolutionary information? Methodology: Here, we trained two auto-regressive language models (Transformer-XL and XLNet) and two auto-encoder models ( BERT and Albert) using 80 billion amino acids from 200 million protein sequences (UniRef100) and 393 billion amino acids  from 2.1 billion protein sequences ( BFD ). The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer , using 5616 GPUs  and one TPU Pod , using V3-512 cores. Results: The results of training these LMs on proteins was assessed by predicting secondary structure in three- and eight-states ( Q3= 75-83, Q8= 63-72), localization for 10 cellular compartments (Q10=74) and whether a protein is membrane-bound or water-soluble (Q2=89). Dimensionality reduction revealed that the LM-embeddings from unlabelled data (only protein sequences) captured important biophysical properties of the protein alphabet, namely the amino acids, and their well orchestrated interplay in governing the shapeof proteins.

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 123. also spelled Malecite), are an Algonquian-speaking First Nation of the Wabanaki Confederacy. They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States . Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland . Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. Wlastkw means \"Beautiful River.\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. Wlastkwewiyik means \"People of the Beautiful River,\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007.

Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  .

Unfinished\/aborted music At one point, the music exists in the composer's mind. In 1928, Edgard Varse started working on an opera called L'Astronome based on North American Indian legends, a project he never completed and destroyed the drafts. In 1932, he asked Antonin Artaud to write the libretto of a large scale oratorio, Il n'ya plus de firmament (There is no longer any firmament). In his book Phantasmatic Radio Allen S. Weiss translates the beginning of Artaud's text: {{cquote|Darkness. Explosions in this darkness. Harmonies suddenly broken off. Harsh sounds. Depressurized soundings. The music will give the impression of a distant cataclysm and will fill the room, falling as from vertiginous heights. Chords will originate in the sky and then deteriorate, going from one extreme to the other. Sounds will fall as if from very high, then suddenly stop and spread out in bursts, forming vaults and parasols. Tiers of sounds... in Phantasmatic Radio Allen S. Weiss, Phantasmatic Radio, Duke University Press, 1995, page 42}} The piece was never completed and Varse turned to other projects, including a radiophonic work involving various synchronised choirs located in different places of the world. He never found the technology for it. In 1948, Artaud insisted on having noise sounds included in his Pour en finir avec le judgement de Dieu (To have done with the judgment of God). This was done in the Radiodiffusion Television Franaise studios where Pierre Schaeffer was working at the time.

In the latter volume, Charles Swann associates strong emotions and memories to the melody composed by Vinteuil. The French composer Reynaldo Hahn noticed how much Marcel Proust \"vivait la musique de son temps\" (experienced contemporary music).See Adrien De Vries' article : Sources de la Sonate de Vinteuil, April 2007 (in French) For example, Proust immediately praised and enjoyed Debussy's 1902 Pellas et Mlisande opera. Critics disagree on which composer inspired the sonata. Possibly Gabriel FaurSee Margaret Hunter and Abigail Al-Doory's article: L'homme et la Musique Dans Un Amour de Swann, 1996 or Csar Franck. In Les plaisirs et les jours (1896), Proust focusses on Hans Sachs's monologue from Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nrnberg, act 2. In Jean Santeuil (1952), a Camille Saint-Sans sonata for violin and piano (Op. 75, 1885) plays a key role and is presumably the model for the Sonate de Vinteuil. In Un amour de Swann  , the Vinteuil Sonata is played during evenings at the Verdurins' by pianist Dechambre. The main character's emotions are mirrored by Proust's musical reminiscences.

In 2008, Kosovo declared independence and has since been recognized by 96 countries. However, Serbia maintains that Kosovo continues to be its territory.

Clinton assigned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State ambassador Philip Reeker to support Ashton's efforts. Reeker and his team coordinated closely with EU colleagues and met with Serbian and Kosovar representatives on the margins of every dialogue session in Brussels, and during visits to the region.

How can neural models make sample-efficient generalizations from task--language combinations with available data to low-resource ones? In this work, we propose a Bayesian generative model for the space of neural parameters. We assume that this space can be factorized into latent variables for each language and each task. We infer the posteriors over such latent variables based on data from seen task--language combinations through variational inference. This enables zero-shot classification on unseen combinations at prediction time. For instance, given training data for named entity recognition (NER) in Vietnamese and for part-of-speech (POS) tagging in Wolof, our model can perform accurate predictions for NER in Wolof. In particular, we experiment with a typologically diverse sample of 33 languages from 4 continents and 11 families, and show that our model yields comparable or better results than state-of-the-art, zero-shot cross-lingual transfer methods. Moreover, we demonstrate that approximate Bayesian model averaging results in smoother predictive distributions, whose entropy strongly correlates with accuracy.

Reinforcement learning (RL) deals with the problem through using non-differentiable evaluation metrics (e.g., the success rate) as rewards. Nonetheless, existing works with RL showed that the comprehensibility of generated system utterances could be corrupted when improving the performance on fulfilling user requests. In our work, we (1) propose modelling the hierarchical structure between dialogue policy and natural language generator (NLG) with the option framework, called HDNO  ; (2) train HDNO with hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), as well as suggest alternating updates between dialogue policy and NLG during HRL inspired by fictitious play, to preserve the comprehensibility of generated system utterances while improving fulfilling user requests ; and (3) propose using a discriminator modelled with language models as an additional reward to further improve the comprehensibility.

{"doc_id":2002.09616,"context":"Producing natural and accurate responses like human beings is the ultimate goal of intelligent dialogue agents. So far, most of the past works concentrate on selecting or generating one pertinent and fluent response according to current query and its context. These models work on a one-to-one environment, making one response to one utterance each round.However, in real human-human conversations, human often sequentially sends several short messages for readability instead of a long message in one turn. Thus messages will not end with an explicit ending signal, which is crucial for agents to decide when to reply. So the first step for an intelligent dialogue agent is not replying but deciding if it should reply at the moment. To address this issue, in this paper , we propose a novel Imagine-then-Arbitrate (ITA) neural dialogue model to help the agent decide whether to wait or to make a response directly. Our method has two imaginator modules and an arbitrator module. The two imaginators will learn the agent's and user's speaking style respectively, generate possible utterances as the input of the arbitrator, combining with dialogue history. And the arbitrator decides whether to wait or to make a response to the user directly.

The propaganda campaign, which specifically targets 14 to 19 year-olds aims to reduce the number of young people experimenting with the soft drug. The advertisements are the result of a tightening of cannabis laws in NSW last year. The propaganda , which NSW Health has cost at AUD$600,000 , that could of been spent on feeding starving children, will use a variety of print ads placed at bus stops and in youth magazines in addition to propaganda messages on websites such as MySpace and MSN. Propaganda ads use a tag line saying \"Pot. It mightn't kill you, but it could turn politicians into dickheads \". The propaganda images show a person staring from a black and white photo with quotes like \"You've got great eyes, dialated eyes are hot \" and \"I'd lend you money, but the government would just spend it on these ads \" , as part of an emotional appeal to manipulate the reader into an unfair bias on the topic, instead of comparing facts and science to the message they are promoting . The director of drug and alcohol programs with NSW Health, David McGrath said many young people know that cannabis was safe and its use was normal. \"There is still a significant cohort of people who think, particularly with the young person's age group, that cannabis is normal,\" Mr McGrath said. Mr McGrath said despite the number of young cannabis users had halved from forty percent to twenty percent, but claimed more needed to be done. \"We want to prevent people who are thinking about taking cannabis up from taking it up and also encouraging those people that are using cannabis to cease, through use of unrelenting lies and social shunning \" he said. Mr McGrath said young people had to be warned about the possible consequences of smoking cannabis, such as the alleged link with comedians and how it may improve social interaction and physical health. NSW Health Minister, Reba Meagher said a recent study indicated that while cannabis use among young people is in decline, almost one third of teenagers have tried cannabis.

{"doc_id":5467330.0,"context":"Herbert Richard Baumeister (April 7, 1947 July 3, 1996) was an American  suspected serial killer. A resident of the Indianapolis suburb of Westfield, Indiana, he was under investigation for murdering over a dozen men in the early 1990s, most of whom were last seen at gay bars. Police found the remains of eleven persons, eight identified, on Baumeister's property. After an arrest warrant was issued, Baumeister fled to Canada and killed himself before he could be brought to trial. He never confessed to the crimes and his suicide note made no mention of the murder allegations. He was later linked to a series of murders of at least nine men along Interstate 70, which occurred in the early to mid-1980s. Early life  Baumeister was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the oldest of four children born to Herbert and Elizabeth Baumeister. His childhood was reportedly normal . By the onset of adolescence, he began exhibiting anti-social behavior . Acquaintances later recalled the young Baumeister playing with dead animals and urinating on a teacher's desk , which are textbook signs of a burgeoning serial killer . In his teens, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia , but did not receive further psychiatric treatment. In 1965, Baumeister attended Indiana University for a semester before dropping out, but returned in 1967. In 1972, he attended a semester at Butler University. As an adult, he drifted through a series of jobs, marked by a strong work ethic , but also by increasingly bizarre behavior. Baumeister married Juliana \"Julie\" Saiter in November 1971, a union that produced three children. Julie later said they had been sexually intimate only six times in over 25 years of marriage. In the 1970s, Baumeister was committed to a psychiatric hospital by his father . His wife said he was \"hurting and needed help.\" Baumeister founded the successful Sav-A-Lot thrift store chain (two stores total) in Indianapolis in 1988. Investigation By the early 1990s, investigators with the Marion County Sheriff's Department and the Indianapolis Police Department began investigating the disappearances of gay men of similar age, height, and weight in the Indianapolis area. In 1992, they were contacted by a man named Tony Harris claiming that a gay bar patron calling himself \"Brian Smart\" had killed a friend of his, and had attempted to kill him with a pool hose during an erotic asphyxiation session. Harris eventually saw this man again in August 1995, following him and noting a license plate number. From this data, police identified \"Brian Smart\" as Herb Baumeister. Investigators approached Baumeister, told him he was a suspect in the disappearances, and asked to search his house. Both Baumeister and his wife, Julie, refused to allow a search of their house . By June 1996, however, Julie had become sufficiently frightened by her husband's mood swings and erratic behavior that, after filing for divorce, she consented to a search. The search of the estate, Fox Hollow Farm, was conducted while Baumeister was on vacation. It turned up the remains of eleven men, eight of whom were identified. Baumeister would posthumously be suspected of killing nine other men, the bodies of whom were found in rural areas along the corridor of Interstate 70 between Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio  during the early to mid 1980s. One eyewitness identified Baumeister as the man seen leaving a bar in 1983 with Michael Riley, who was later found dead. Like the other victims, Riley was strangled to death and deposited nude or semi-nude in a river.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" By June 1996, however, Julie had become sufficiently frightened by her husband's mood swings and erratic behavior that, after filing for divorce, she consented to a search.","after_edit":" By June 1996, however, Julie had become sufficiently frightened by her husband's  erratic behavior that, after filing for divorce, she consented to a search.","start_sent_pos":2770,"end_sent_pos":2943,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

According to the Humane Society, most internet hunts involve game ranches where animals are kept penned, making them essentially canned hunts.Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, Another less well-known incident occurred  two years prior to the Dick Cheney hunting incident when the vice president participated in a canned hunt at the Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania. Cheney and nine companions killed 417 out of 500 ringneck pheasants, of which the Vice President killed 70, and an unknown number of mallard ducks. In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country. South Africa environment minister announced long-awaited restrictions on lion hunting, declaring he was sickened by wealthy tourists shooting tame lions from the back of a truck and felling rhinos with a bow and arrow. This comes in response to the imbroglio created over the potential canned hunt of the African rhinoceros 'Baixinha.' Dismissing threats of legal action by the hunting industry, Marthinus Van Schalkwyk said the new law would ban \"canned\" hunting of big predators and rhinos in small enclosures that offer them no means of escape. In addition, lions bred in captivity would have to be released into the open for at least two years before they could be hunted. Van Schalkwyk said a previously proposed six-month delay would not give lions enough time to develop self-defence instincts. \"Hunting should be about fair chase ... testing the wits of a hunter against that of the animal,\" he told a press conference. \"Over the years that got eroded and now we are trying to re-establish that principle.\" This measure was later overturned. In May 2007 a much-reported hunting trip involved the killing of 1,051pound pet pig in an alleged canned hunt. The pig was named \"Monster Pig\" by the media and it was believed that the pig was a feral hog . It was soon discovered that the pig, previously named \"Fred , \"  had been someone's pet and was then sold to a hunting facility only a brief time before he was killed. On May 3, paying customers Mike Stone and his 11-year-old son , Jamison , hunted him in a fenced enclosure. Jamison shot Fred a total of eight times over a period of three hours. A June 2007 story on CNN detailed canned hunting in South Africa and includes a video of a canned lion hunt where the animal is shot against a fence. On November 30, 2014, CBS  60 Minutes broadcast a story (\"The Lion Whisperer\") about one man's sanctuary in South Africa for 26 lions, raised in captivity, who he rescued from the fate of canned lion hunting. In November 2015, the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa (PHASA) voted to disassociate itself from the practice of canned lion hunting in South Africa. Unless the conservation value of canned lion hunting is demonstrated to PHASA, URLanization will remain against the practice and, under penalty of expulsion, no PHASA members will be permitted to participate canned lion hunts. In November 2017  PHASA came under fire over the body's reversal of its 2015 policy against the hunting of captive-bred lions.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, Another less well-known incident occurred  two years prior to the Dick Cheney hunting incident when the vice president participated in a canned hunt at the Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania.","after_edit":"Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, Another less well-known incident occurred  two years prior to the infamous hunting accident, when then-Vice President Dick Cheney participated in a canned hunt at the Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania.","start_sent_pos":318,"end_sent_pos":567,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","meaning-changed"],"label":"clarity"}

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time.

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 123. also spelled Malecite), are an Algonquian-speaking First Nation of the Wabanaki Confederacy. They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States . Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland . Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. Wlastkw means \"Beautiful River.\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. Wlastkwewiyik means \"People of the Beautiful River,\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007. Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years. Despite devastating population losses to European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, these Atlantic First Nations held on to their traditional coastal or river locations for hunting, fishing and gathering , and were concentrated along river valleys for trapping.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name.","after_edit":" The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for this people, not understanding that it was not their true name.","start_sent_pos":2295,"end_sent_pos":2469,"raw_intents":["others","fluency","fluency"],"label":"fluency"}

(2) To which extent can LMs extract features from single proteins to get closer to the performance of methods using evolutionary information? Methodology: Here, we trained two auto-regressive language models (Transformer-XL and XLNet) and two auto-encoder models ( BERT and Albert) using 80 billion amino acids from 200 million protein sequences (UniRef100) and 393 billion amino acids  from 2.1 billion protein sequences ( BFD ). The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer , using 5616 GPUs  and one TPU Pod , using V3-512 cores.

{"doc_id":63624111.0,"context":"Tropical arctic The tropical arctic zone covers the overlapping regions of the tropical and arctic zones. This unique climatic zone is only possible on objects that have an obliquity range between 45 and 135. Since the obliquity of Pluto varies between a minimum of 103 and a maximum of 127, it therefore has a tropical arctic climate zone. This high obliquity implies that most of Pluto's surface experiences both tropical and arctic climates over the 2.8 million year obliquity cycle. The tropical arctic zone includes the region that overlaps between tropical and arctic zones extending between 13N to 77N and 13S to 77S. At this latitudinal range the zones cover 75\\% of the total surface area. However, like the oscillation of tropical (between 53 and 77 latitude) and arctic (between 13 and 37 latitude) zones, the tropical arctic zone also expands and contrasts over the course of the obliquity cycle. Only the latitude range between 37 to 57 in each hemisphere remains stable over the period, and therefore, those bands are called the permanent tropical arctic zones on Pluto (which covers 20\\% of the total area). Polar Pluto's polar zone comprises those areas where the Sun never reaches the zenith at any time of the orbital period of the dwarf planet over its entire obliquity cycle. This region always experiences arctic climate, never tropical climate, and it consistently experiences the longest duration of arctic winter and summer during each and every orbital rotation of Pluto.

{"doc_id":20254389.0,"context":"Early Middle Ages, 500-1000 AD The social, political, economic stagnation and decline that followed the Roman World affected Europe throughout the early medieval period, and had critical impact upon technological progress, trade and URLanization. Technological developments that affected the course of metal production were only feasible within a stable political environment, and this was not the case until the 9th century (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, a). During the first medieval centuries, the output of metal was in a steady decline and constraint in small scale activities. Miners adopted methods much less efficient than those of the Roman times. Ores were extracted only from shallow depths or from remnants of former abandoned mines. The vicinity of the mine to villages or towns was also a determinant factor when deciding about working on site , because of the high cost of material transportation (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, b). Apparently only the output of iron diminished less in relation to the other base and precious metals until the 8th century. This fact, correlated with the dramatic decrease in copper production, may indicate a possible displacement of copper and bronze artifacts by iron ones (Forbes 1957, 64; Bayley et al. 2008, 50). By the end of the 9th century, economic  and social conditions , that dictated the increased need of metal for agriculture, arms, stirrups and decoration, started to favor metallurgy and a slow but steady general progress was noted . Starting from the reign of the emperor Otto I in the 960s, smelting sites were multiplied. New mines were discovered and exploited, like the well-known Mines of Rammelsberg, close to the town of Goslar in the Harz Mountains.

In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome.

It is alleged by the Pakistani government that he was arrested in the Pakistani province of Balochistan on charges of terrorism and spying for India's  Research and Analysis Wing. On 10 April 2017, India's Ministry of External Affairs stated that he had been \"kidnapped last year from Iran and his subsequent presence in Pakistan has never been explained credibly\". The Pakistani government claimed that he was a commander in the Indian Navy who was involved in subversive activities inside Pakistan and was arrested on 3 March 2016 during a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan. The Indian government recognised Jadhav as a former naval officer but denied any current links with him and maintained that he took premature retirement and operated a business in Iranian city of Chabahar and was abducted from there .Revealed: 'Spy' Kulbhushan Yadav not caught but abducted by extremist Sunni group Jaishul Adil , India Today, 30 March 2016. Pakistani security forces reported Jadhav as a serving officer in the Indian Navy and stated that he was commissioned to the Research and Analysis Wing  , India's external intelligence agency. They believed him to be involved in subversive activities in Balochistan and Karachi. Jadhav was soon shifted to Islamabad for interrogation. While according to Indian sources, Jadhav was kidnapped by Mullah Shahozi of Jaish ul-Adl from Chabahar and was transported via Sarbaz to IranPakistan border and where he handed Jadhav over to the Pakistani Army. In a statement issued in the Parliament of India on 11 April 2017, Rajnath Singh, India's Minister of Home Affairs, reiterated that Jadhav was kidnapped by Pakistani agencies from Iran and put through trial as a R AW agent. Sushma Swaraj, India's Minister of External Affairs said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Jadhav and termed his sentencing an act of \"premeditated murder\". Swaraj said that if Pakistan implemented the death sentence, the bilateral relations between both countries would face dire consequences. The ICJ proceedings began in The Hague on 15 May to review the case. India and Pakistan both sent their legal teams to put forward their arguments, led by Harish Salve and Khawar Qureshi QC respectively. On 18 May 2017, the International Court of Justice stayed the hanging of Jadhav by Pakistan . On 22 June 2017, Pakistani sources confirmed that Jadhav had sought clemency from the country's army chief following his conviction. Pakistan also released a new confessional video of Jadhav, in which he stated that he visited Karachi twice for gathering intelligence on naval facilities. He also admitted to supporting and funding, on behalf of R AW , Baloch militants affiliated with the BLA and BRA, in addition to infiltrating and establishing \"30 to 40 R AW operatives along the Makran Coast\" for involvement in terrorist activities. Jadhav said that R AW 's activities in Balochistan and Sindh were conducted under the direction of Anil Kumar Dhasmana. India's Foreign Ministry again dismissed the confession as \"false propaganda\", stating that Pakistan was trying to influence ICJ proceedings while denying the consular rights to Jadhav. ICJ did not allow Pakistan to play the video during the hearing. On 17 July 2019, the ICJ, in its verdict, rejected India's appeal for Jadhav's release and directed Pakistan to allow consular access and effectively Stayed the death sentence. The court ordered that Pakistan should grant consular access to Jhadav.

{"doc_id":33653387.0,"context":"In this way, Persian became a second language to many across North India;  Alam contends that it neared the status of a first language. By the 18th century, many Indians in the north of the subcontinent had a \"native speaker's competence in Persian\".Faruqi, Shamsur Rahman (2003), \"A Long History of Urdu Literarature, Part 1\", in Pollock (ed.), Literary cultures in history: reconstructions from South Asia, p. 849, Decline Following Aurangzeb's death, Persian began to fall into decline, being displaced by Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu). The arrival and strengthening of British political power added a growing influence of English as well. However, for a long time Persian was still the dominant language of the subcontinent, used in education, Muslim rule, the judiciary, and literature. The East India Company acknowledged Persian as a \"language of command\", necessary to communicate with and control the Indian population. Hence many British officials arriving in India learned Persian in colleges established by the Company. The teachers in these colleges were often Indian. In some cases, Britishers even took over as Persian professors, sidelining the role of the Indians. Deccan A Persian poem produced in the Deccan. 17th century.|346x346px Although considerably distanced from North India, the Deccan was also a recipient of Persian's linguistic impact. Persianate culture was brought to the Deccan fleetingly through the efforts of the Delhi Sultanate in the early 14th century. Persian finally gained a foothold in the region with the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate in 1347, which used the language for official purposes. The dynasty had a great interest in Persian culture, and several members were proficient in the language, producing their own literature. Literati from Northern India found themselves welcome at the court, and scholars from Iran were invited as well. Madrasas were built over the expanse of the kingdom, most notably the Mahmud Gawan Madrasa at Bidar, where Persian was taught.  In spite of this, Persian did not achieve the linguistic penetration it had in the north of the subcontinent. Richard Eaton writes that Persian was much less widely understood in the  region than vernacular languages  . During the turn of the 16th century, the Bahmani Sultanate splintered into the Deccan Sultanates, which were also Persianate in culture. They used Persian as a courtly language, as well as for official and administrative purposes. The language received literary patronage  . However, the sultans simultaneously promoted regional languages such as Telugu, Marathi, and Deccani (the southern variety of Hindustani), at times even using them in administration.  The reign of the Deccan Sultanates lasted until the late 17th century, when Aurangzeb brought the region into the Mughal Empire and established Aurangabad as the Deccan's capital. As was Mughal practice, Persian was used in many levels of administration. Major cities of this region that served as centres of Persian patronage included Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda. Notable Persian literature produced includes Futuh-us-Salatin, and the Bahmannamh . Influence on Indic languages As a prestige language and lingua franca over a period of 800 years in the Indian subcontinent, Classical Persian exerted a vast influence over numerous Indic languages. Generally speaking, the degree of impact is seen to increase the more one moves towards the north-west of the subcontinent, i.e. the Indo-Iranian frontier. For example, the Indo-Aryan languages have the most impact from Persian; this ranges from a high appearance in Punjabi, Sindhi, Kashmiri, and Gujarati, to more moderate representation in Bengali and Marathi. The largest foreign element in the Indo-Aryan languages is Persian. Conversely, the Dravidian languages have seen a low level of influence from Persian. They still feature loans from the language, some of which are direct, and some through Deccani (the southern variety of Hindustani), due to the Islamic rulers of the Deccan. Telugu is a good example of this (see Telangana Baasha for the Telugu dialect accentuated with these features).

Though Arabic largely dominates the realm of Islamic liturgy and theology in the Indian subcontinent, Persian can also be seen in some religious spheres: the dhikr sessions of Sufism often employ Persian poetry in song, and the Sufi devotional music genre of qawwali also uses Persian in parallel with local languages.

{"doc_id":5467330.0,"context":"Herbert Richard Baumeister (April 7, 1947 July 3, 1996) was an American  suspected serial killer. A resident of the Indianapolis suburb of Westfield, Indiana, he was under investigation for murdering over a dozen men in the early 1990s, most of whom were last seen at gay bars. Police found the remains of eleven persons, eight identified, on Baumeister's property. After an arrest warrant was issued, Baumeister fled to Canada and killed himself before he could be brought to trial. He never confessed to the crimes and his suicide note made no mention of the murder allegations. He was later linked to a series of murders of at least nine men along Interstate 70, which occurred in the early to mid-1980s. Early life  Baumeister was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the oldest of four children born to Herbert and Elizabeth Baumeister. His childhood was reportedly normal . By the onset of adolescence, he began exhibiting anti-social behavior . Acquaintances later recalled the young Baumeister playing with dead animals and urinating on a teacher's desk , which are textbook signs of a burgeoning serial killer . In his teens, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia , but did not receive further psychiatric treatment. In 1965, Baumeister attended Indiana University for a semester before dropping out, but returned in 1967. In 1972, he attended a semester at Butler University. As an adult, he drifted through a series of jobs, marked by a strong work ethic , but also by increasingly bizarre behavior. Baumeister married Juliana \"Julie\" Saiter in November 1971, a union that produced three children. Julie later said they had been sexually intimate only six times in over 25 years of marriage. In the 1970s, Baumeister was committed to a psychiatric hospital by his father . His wife said he was \"hurting and needed help.\" Baumeister founded the successful Sav-A-Lot thrift store chain (two stores total) in Indianapolis in 1988. Investigation By the early 1990s, investigators with the Marion County Sheriff's Department and the Indianapolis Police Department began investigating the disappearances of gay men of similar age, height, and weight in the Indianapolis area. In 1992, they were contacted by a man named Tony Harris claiming that a gay bar patron calling himself \"Brian Smart\" had killed a friend of his, and had attempted to kill him with a pool hose during an erotic asphyxiation session. Harris eventually saw this man again in August 1995, following him and noting a license plate number. From this data, police identified \"Brian Smart\" as Herb Baumeister. Investigators approached Baumeister, told him he was a suspect in the disappearances, and asked to search his house. Both Baumeister and his wife, Julie, refused to allow a search of their house . By June 1996, however, Julie had become sufficiently frightened by her husband's mood swings and erratic behavior that, after filing for divorce, she consented to a search. The search of the estate, Fox Hollow Farm, was conducted while Baumeister was on vacation. It turned up the remains of eleven men, eight of whom were identified. Baumeister would posthumously be suspected of killing nine other men, the bodies of whom were found in rural areas along the corridor of Interstate 70 between Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio  during the early to mid 1980s. One eyewitness identified Baumeister as the man seen leaving a bar in 1983 with Michael Riley, who was later found dead. Like the other victims, Riley was strangled to death and deposited nude or semi-nude in a river.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In his teens, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia , but did not receive further psychiatric treatment.","after_edit":" In his teens, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia  but did not receive further psychiatric treatment.","start_sent_pos":1114,"end_sent_pos":1217,"raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"],"label":"fluency"}

The existence group is concerned with  providing the basic material existence requirements of humans. They include the items that Maslow considered to be physiological and safety needs. The second group of needs is those of relatedness the desire people have for maintaining important interpersonal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs: an intrinsic desire for personal development. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization. Alderfer categorized the lower order needs (Physiological and Safety) into the Existence category. He fit Maslow's interpersonal love and esteem needs into the Relatedness category. The Growth category contained the self-actualization and self-esteem needs  . Alderfer also proposed a  regression theory to go along with the ERG theory . He said that when needs in a higher category are not met then individuals redouble the efforts invested in a lower category need .

Conservation land trusts The Land Trust Alliance, formed in 1981, provides technical support to land trusts in the United States. The Alliance performs a National Land Trust Census that keeps track of the land protected by local and regional land trusts. The last Census, conducted in 2003, reported that these trusts have protected almost 9.4million acres (38,000km2) of land in the United States, double the 4.7million acres (19,000km2) recorded in the 1998 survey. Over 5million acres (20,000km2) of that was protected by conservation easement in 2003. Although it does not include national or international land trusts in its Census, the LTA estimates another 25million acres (100,000km2) in the U.S. have been protected by URLanizations. The largest amount of land protected by local and regional trusts is in the Northeast with 2.9million acres (12,000km2), while the fastest growing region between 1998 and 2003 was the Pacific (consisting of California, Nevada, and Hawaii), with protected land increasing 147\\% to 1.5million acres (6,100km2) in 2003.

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected.","after_edit":" History is no longer subdivided their subject-matter in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected.","start_sent_pos":2237,"end_sent_pos":2347,"raw_intents":["meaning-changed","clarity","meaning-changed"],"label":"meaning-changed"}

{"doc_id":172474.0,"context":"Exercise and lactate During power exercises such as sprinting, when the rate of demand for energy is high, glucose is broken down and oxidized to pyruvate , and lactate is then produced from the pyruvate faster than the body can process it, causing lactate concentrations to rise.  The production of lactate is beneficial for NAD+ regeneration (pyruvate is reduced to lactate while NADH is oxidized to NAD+), which is used up in oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate during production of pyruvate from glucose, and this ensures that energy production is maintained and exercise can continue. During intense exercise, the respiratory chain cannot keep up with the amount of hydrogen ions that join to form NADH, and cannot regenerate NAD+ quickly enough. However, lactate is continually formed at rest and during all exercise intensities. With the use of stable isotopic tracers URLe Brooks and colleagues, at the University of California, Berkeley, observed that lactate served as a metabolic fuel being produced and oxidatively disposed in resting and exercising muscle. Some causes of this are metabolism in red blood cells that lack mitochondria, and limitations resulting from the enzyme activity that occurs in muscle fibers having high glycolytic capacity. In 2004, Robergs et al. maintained that lactic acidosis during exercise is a \"construct\" or myth, pointing out that part of the H+ comes from ATP hydrolysis (ATP4 + H2O ADP3 + + H+), and that reducing pyruvate to lactate (pyruvate + NADH + H+ lactate + NAD+) actually consumes H+. Lindinger et al. countered that they had ignored the causative factors of the increase in [H+]. After all, the production of lactate from a neutral molecule must increase [H+] to maintain electroneutrality. The point of Robergs's paper, however, was that lactate is produced from pyruvate, which has the same charge. It is pyruvate production from neutral glucose that generates H+: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Subsequent lactate production absorbs these protons: 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH 2 + 2NAD+ Overall: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O 2 + 2NAD+ + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Although the reaction glucose 2lactate + 2H+ releases two H+ when viewed on its own, the H+ are absorbed in the production of ATP.

{"doc_id":29326123.0,"context":"Research has examined goal orientation as a motivation variable that is useful for recruitment, climate and culture, performance appraisal, and choice.DeGeest, D., & Brown, K. G. (2011). The role of goal orientation in leadership development. Human Resource Development Quarterly, 22(2), 157-175. Studies have also used goal orientation to predict sales performance, adaptive performanceStasielowicz, L. (2019). Goal orientation and performance adaptation: A meta-analysis. Journal of Research in Personality, 82., goal setting, learning and adaptive behaviors in training, and leadership. Historical perspective Dweck proposed that there are two types of goal orientation: learning orientation and performance orientation.Dweck, C.S. (1986). Motivational processes affecting learning. American Psychologist, 41, 1040-1048. Dweck postulated that children with learning goals were believed to approach situations to master the acquisition of new skills, while children with performance goals were believed to approach situations to gain approval from peers and teachers. Like Eison, Dweck conceptualized goal orientation as a two-dimension construct. Individuals with a learning goal orientation (sometimes referred to as mastery goal orientation; abbreviated as LGO) seek to develop their competence by acquiring new skills and mastering new situations. They are not concerned about their performance relative to others, but rather with furthering their understanding of a given topic or task.Hendricks, J.W., & Payne, S.C. (2007). Beyond the Big Five: Leader goal orientation as a predictor of leadership effectiveness. Human Performance, 20, 317-343. Individuals with a performance goal orientation seek to demonstrate and validate the adequacy of their competence to receive favorable compliments while avoiding negative judgments. Although Dweck's work in this area built on the foundation laid by Nicholls, the fundamental difference between the two scholars' works was the attribution of an individual's goal orientation: Nicholls believed that the goal orientation held by an individual was a result of the possession of either an internal or external referent, while Dweck considered the adoption of a particular goal orientation to be related to the theory of intelligence held by that individual. Subsequent work by Eison and colleagues in 1982 led to a change in the conceptualization of these orientations from two ends of a continuum to two separate constructs.Eison, J.A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1982). LOGO II: A user's manual. Knoxville: University of Tennessee, Learning Research Center. More recently, researchers have embraced the idea that individuals can adopt the two orientation styles simultaneously: persons can be independently high or low in learning and performance orientations. Ultimately, individuals can entertain multiple competing goal orientations at the same time, and strive to both outperform competitors and improve their performance. This line of thinking led to the conceptualization of two separate continua: one for learning goal orientation and one for performance goal orientation.Eison, J. A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1986). Educational and personal characteristics of four different types of learning- and grade-oriented students. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 11, 5467. State versus trait There has been great debate as to whether goal orientation should be operationalized as a state or as a trait. Throughout the goal orientation literature, there are inconsistencies about the conceptualization of the stability of the construct. For example, DeShon & Gillespie stated that in the literature, DeShon, R. P., & Gillespie, J. Z. (2005). A motivated action theory account of goal orientation. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(6), 1096-1127. goal orientation has been conceptualized as a trait, quasi-trait, and state. They states that whether researchers conceptualize goal orientation as a trait or a state \"depends on the breadth of the inference that the researcher is attempting to support\". State goal orientation refers to the goal one has in a particular situation . It is similar to trait goal orientation in that it represents one's preference in an achievement situation. Button, Mathieu, & Zajac take an integrative view of the construct,Button, S. B., Mathieu, J. E., & Zajac, D. M. (1996, July). Goal orientation URLanizational research: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 67(1), 26-48. stating that goal orientation is best categorized as a relatively stable individual difference variable that can be influenced by situational and contextual characteristics. They found that when few situational cues are present, individuals will adopt their dispositional goal orientations. However, when \"dispositional goal orientations predispose individuals to adopt particular response patterns across situations, situational characteristics may cause them to adopt a different or less acute response pattern for a specific situation\". Therefore, trait and state goal orientations interact, and both should be considered simultaneously. Types Since the realization that performance goal orientation is most effectively split into two separate parts, researchers have conducted validation studies to demonstrate the statistical and conceptual distinction of three dimensions to goal orientation. Conceptual and empirical work by Elliot and Church and VandeWalle demonstrated that the factor structure of goal orientation lends itself to three distinct dimensions as summarized below .Elliot, A. J. Church, M. A. (1997). A hierarchical model of approach and avoidance achievement motivation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, 218-232. An explanation of the learning-approach and learning-avoidance goal orientations are also included for completeness. Antecedents Throughout the goal orientation literature, many studies have examined relationships between goal orientation and various antecedents. These antecedents have been identified to have varying levels of importance. In a meta-analysis by Payne et al., both the need for achievement and the Big Five personality traits were identified as important antecedents of goal orientation, while cognitive ability was found to have almost no relationship with goal orientation. The following sections go into more detail about each antecedent. Payne and her colleagues did not distinguish between proximal and distal antecedents. Another factor to consider when examining the relationship between goal orientation and goal setting is the level of inherent complexity in the situation or task. In situations with more complex tasks, it appears that \"do your best\" goals may lead to higher performance than specific goals. It is possible that in complex tasks, a specific, difficult goal imposes greater cognitive demands on employees, making it difficult for them to learn the complex task due to this increased pressure.Latham, G.P & Seijts, G.H. (1999). The effects of proximal and distal goals on performance on a moderately complex task. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 2, 81-127. Kanfer and Ackerman found that in an air traffic controller simulation (a highly complex task),Kanfer, R. Ackerman, P. L. (1989). Motivation and cognitive abilities: An integrative\/aptitude-treatment interaction approach to skill acquisition. Journal of Applied Psychology, 74, 657-690. performance-outcome goals interfered with acquiring the knowledge necessary to perform the task, and individuals performed better when they were asked to do their best, suggesting that adopting a learning orientation may be appropriate for complex tasks or in specific settings. However, it may be possible to set a specific, difficult learning goal. Latham and Brown found that when MBA students set specific, difficult learning goals such as mastering complex course material,Latham, G. P. Brown, T. C. (2006). The effect of learning vs. outcome goals on self-efficacy and satisfaction in an MBA program. Applied Psychology: An International Review, 55, 606-623. they outperformed MBA students who set a performance goal for GPA. Locke and Latham claim that creating a specific, difficult learning goal in this type of situation facilitates meta-cognition which is particularly helpful in complex environments with limited guidance, such as in an MBA program. Organizational outcomes Goal orientation has also been linked URLanizational outcomes, specifically job performance. Payne et al. found that individuals with high levels of trait and state LGO and low levels of trait APGO had better job performance, that PPGO was unrelated to performance, and that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond both cognitive ability and the Big Five personality characteristics. Their findings suggest that LGO is a valuable predictor of job performance and it may be in the best interest URLanizations to create a climate in which learning is valued over performance.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Antecedents Throughout the goal orientation literature, many studies have examined relationships between goal orientation and various antecedents.","after_edit":" Antecedents Many studies have examined relationships between goal orientation and various antecedents.","start_sent_pos":5888,"end_sent_pos":6035,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

Otter argued that during the period of election petition signature collection, Murphy had signed his name as the circulator on two petition sheets, but was not present for each signature that was signed on those sheets, and thereby breaking PA state law. Current law states that whoever signs a petition sheet as a circulator must be present for each signature , and see each signature placed on the sheet. Murphy admitted that he was not at the sheet for every signature, and  agreed that the 96 signatures present on those two sheets should be invalidated. He also stated that he was unaware of that particular election statute.

He can't say he doesn't know what the law was. He's been campaigning over a year,\" Otter said.

The information learned is transferred through so-called embeddings to downstream prediction tasks. Bioinformatics provide vast gold-mines of structured and sequentially ordered text data leading to extraordinarily successful protein sequence LMs that promise new frontiers for generative and predictive tasks at low inference cost . Here, we addressed two questions: (1) To which extent can HPC up-scale protein LMs to larger databases and larger models? (2) To which extent can LMs extract features from single proteins to get closer to the performance of methods using evolutionary information? Methodology: Here, we trained two auto-regressive language models (Transformer-XL and XLNet) and two auto-encoder models ( BERT and Albert) using 80 billion amino acids from 200 million protein sequences (UniRef100) and 393 billion amino acids  from 2.1 billion protein sequences ( BFD ).

{"doc_id":51488038.0,"context":"The vulture and the little girl, also known as \"The Struggling Girl\", is a famous photograph by Kevin Carter which first appeared in The New York Times on 26 March 1993. It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a hooded vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan (now South Sudan), in March 1993, and to have survived the incident. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. Carter took his own life four months after winning the prize. Background The Hunger Triangle, a name URLanisations used in the 1990s for the area defined by the southern Sudan communities Kongor, Ayod, and Waat, was dependent on UNESCO and other URLanisations to fight famine. Forty percent of the area's children under 5 years old were malnourished as of January 1993, and an estimated 10 to 13 adults died of starvation daily in Ayod alone. To raise awareness of the situation, Operation Lifeline Sudan invited photojournalists and others, previously excluded from entering the country, to report on conditions. In March 1993, the government began granting visas to journalists for a 24-hour stay with severe restrictions on their travel within the country, including government supervision at all times. Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan. It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva saw this as a chance to work more as a war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested in going. According to fellow war photographer Greg Marinovich, Carter saw the trip as an opportunity to fix some problems \"he felt trapped in\". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\". To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have \"great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan pancake\", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: \"The UN hoped to publish the famine Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for URLanisations to sustain funding\". About the political differences and fighting \"Joo and Kevin knew none of this they just wanted to get in and shoot pictures\". Waiting in Nairobi Silva and Carter had prepared carefully for the trip. They stopped in Nairobi on their way to Sudan. The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region . But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod. In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards. The residents of the hamlet have been looked after by the UN aid station for some time. Greg Marinovich and Joo Silva described that in the book The Bang Bang Club, Chapter 10 \"Flies and Hungry People\". The child was already cared for before Kevin Carter and Joo Silva landed there and Carter took his famous picture. Marinovich wrote that the villagers were already waiting next to the runway to get the food as quickly as possible: \"Mothers who had joined the throng waiting for food left their children on the sandy ground nearby.\" Silva and Carter separated to take pictures of both children and adults, both the living and dead, all victims of the catastrophic famine that had arisen through the war. Carter went several times to Silva to tell him about the shocking situation he had just photographed. Witnessing the famine affected him emotionally. Silva was searching for rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority and when he found some soldiers Carter joined him. The soldiers did not speak English, but one was interested in Carter's watch. Carter gave him his cheap wristwatch as a gift. The soldiers became their bodyguards and followed them for their protection. To stay a week with the rebels they needed the permission of a rebel commander. Their plane was due to depart in an hour and without the permission to stay they would be forced to fly out. Again they separated and Silva went to the clinic complex to ask for the rebel commander and he was told the commander was in Kongor, South Sudan. This was good news for Silva, as \"their little UN plane was heading there next\". He left the clinic and went back to the runway, taking pictures of children and adults on his way. He came across a child lying on his face in the hot sun he took a picture. In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of \"fevers\", according to his family.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time.","after_edit":" The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait there for an unspecified period of time.","start_sent_pos":3039,"end_sent_pos":3131,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

The target-side side monolingual data has been used in the back-translation approach to improve the forward (target) translation model. Whereas the success of the approach heavily relies on the additional parallel data generating model -- the backward model -- the aim of the approach is only targeted at improving the forward model. The back-translation approach was designed primarily to benefit from an additional data whose source-side is synthetic.

Green hunting has been advocated as a conservation-minded alternative to destructive sport hunting, because it allows the hunter to experience the thrill of a traditional hunt without killing the animal, leaving the wildlife abundance undiminished and  contributing directly to conservation initiatives.

The hunter may have the additional option to be kept regularly updated on the animal's future movements if the darting was part of a GPS collaring project. Though still costly (sometimes upwards of $25,000 USD), green hunting is more economical as fees are lower than trophy hunting (up to $ 60,000 USD). The fees finance the conservation project that necessitates an immobilized animal for micro-chipping , ear-notching, tissue collection or GPS tracking and any additional funds can be used to support the management of the protected area involved.

It's like a house which anyone can enter in it . If you want to ensure its safety on your house, you should doseveral hard works . That's why the security is a must-have trend in reality.

That aircraft, a Cessna 150, collided with a group of trees , shedding its wings ; before coming to rest on a small country road. The two occupants of the aircraft received slight injuries. South Wales Police have not confirmed whether any motorists or pedestrians were injured when the aircraft , involved in today's accident , made its emergency landing. The aircraft did , however, cause some structural damage to a factory unit on the industrial estate , before coming to a rest, inverted, on the adjacent dual carriageway. According to one eyewitness, the aircraft appeared to have experienced an engine-related problem , seconds before impact. A spokesperson, for Cardiff International Airport said that the aircraft had departed , from Cardiff , at 12:43 BST and that the airport's Air Traffic Control centre had lost contact with the plane. The Civil Aviation Authority's Air Accident Investigation Branch (AAIB) have been informed and are due to begin their investigation , into the crash.","domain":"news","before_edit":" The two occupants of the aircraft received slight injuries.","after_edit":" The two occupants of that aircraft received slight injuries.","start_sent_pos":1526,"end_sent_pos":1586,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

{"doc_id":51488038.0,"context":"The vulture and the little girl, also known as \"The Struggling Girl\", is a famous photograph by Kevin Carter which first appeared in The New York Times on 26 March 1993. It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a hooded vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan (now South Sudan), in March 1993, and to have survived the incident. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. Carter took his own life four months after winning the prize. Background The Hunger Triangle, a name URLanisations used in the 1990s for the area defined by the southern Sudan communities Kongor, Ayod, and Waat, was dependent on UNESCO and other URLanisations to fight famine. Forty percent of the area's children under 5 years old were malnourished as of January 1993, and an estimated 10 to 13 adults died of starvation daily in Ayod alone. To raise awareness of the situation, Operation Lifeline Sudan invited photojournalists and others, previously excluded from entering the country, to report on conditions. In March 1993, the government began granting visas to journalists for a 24-hour stay with severe restrictions on their travel within the country, including government supervision at all times. Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan. It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva saw this as a chance to work more as a war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested in going. According to fellow war photographer Greg Marinovich, Carter saw the trip as an opportunity to fix some problems \"he felt trapped in\". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\". To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have \"great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan pancake\", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: \"The UN hoped to publish the famine Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for URLanisations to sustain funding\". About the political differences and fighting \"Joo and Kevin knew none of this they just wanted to get in and shoot pictures\". Waiting in Nairobi Silva and Carter had prepared carefully for the trip. They stopped in Nairobi on their way to Sudan. The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region . But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod. In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards. The residents of the hamlet have been looked after by the UN aid station for some time. Greg Marinovich and Joo Silva described that in the book The Bang Bang Club, Chapter 10 \"Flies and Hungry People\". The child was already cared for before Kevin Carter and Joo Silva landed there and Carter took his famous picture. Marinovich wrote that the villagers were already waiting next to the runway to get the food as quickly as possible: \"Mothers who had joined the throng waiting for food left their children on the sandy ground nearby.\" Silva and Carter separated to take pictures of both children and adults, both the living and dead, all victims of the catastrophic famine that had arisen through the war. Carter went several times to Silva to tell him about the shocking situation he had just photographed. Witnessing the famine affected him emotionally. Silva was searching for rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority and when he found some soldiers Carter joined him. The soldiers did not speak English, but one was interested in Carter's watch. Carter gave him his cheap wristwatch as a gift. The soldiers became their bodyguards and followed them for their protection. To stay a week with the rebels they needed the permission of a rebel commander. Their plane was due to depart in an hour and without the permission to stay they would be forced to fly out. Again they separated and Silva went to the clinic complex to ask for the rebel commander and he was told the commander was in Kongor, South Sudan. This was good news for Silva, as \"their little UN plane was heading there next\". He left the clinic and went back to the runway, taking pictures of children and adults on his way. He came across a child lying on his face in the hot sun he took a picture. In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of \"fevers\", according to his family.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too.","after_edit":" To pay for the travel , Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too.","start_sent_pos":2300,"end_sent_pos":2465,"raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"],"label":"fluency"}

In the picture is MTube, innovated by Science and Technology Advisory Group of Executive Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Computers and technology bring several conveniences to the modern lifestyle , but it creates risks like computer viruses and hacking. Many people want to enjoy the conveniences brought by new technology, but they may not be aware of its problems. WiMAX , which is a communication standard is mainly promoted by the Taipei Computer Association, in addition to the Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China , is considered by some to be the next generation in mobile devices. Since several Internet crimes are progressively respected by several information security companies , some of them disputed on security of WiMAX. After all, everyone wants to welcome this new technology but is afraid of its problem to bring about security issues. Although some (security) companies analyzed statistics on potential issues to dispute the future of WiMAX, but the question is how will they present their analysis? With opportunities from  two press conferences in Taiwan, Wikinews Journalist Rico Shen briefly and successively interviewed Hsiao-wen Hung, President of Microsoft Research Asia and Li Chang, Deputy Secretary General of Taipei Computer Association. With their experiences in the IT industry, they agreed to comment on this question. __NOTOC__ Hsiao-wen Hung: Information security isn't built within a day . Hsiao-wen Hung: The information security industry isn't built within a simple solution. (Interview audio clip) The improvements of information technology firmly brought on  opportunities, but information security is particularly respected by companies from security industry, As of this , how about the information security? Prior to the  (Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Server 2008) launch, although WiMAX, a next-generation networking technology, will bring on the growth of mobile users, but its future was ever disputed by some companies from information security industry. Hung: Safety and flexibility , its relation is like a paddle . If something wanted to be linkable anywhere, there were still some considerations on security . It's like a house which anyone can enter in it . If you want to ensure its safety on your house, you should doseveral hard works . That's why the security is a must-have trend in reality. As of information securitywhat you mentioned about before , relatively, if a newly-proposed future technology wasn't normally populated, it's a golden opportunity for companies when some security companies properly disputed on its future. Hung: Even though it's safe to lock everything all, but it is inconvenience to lock (them all) . Therefore, some key elements like encryption, password authentication, policy, and some Web 2.0 solutions played key roles in information security. There were some involuntary and deliberate attackers on the Internet , if anyone want to prevent them, a complete planning should do priory . That's why the information security industry is built with several solutions and long-term experiences but not a simple solution in a day. Li Chang: Convergences will be brought for security and IT industries . Li Chang: Convergences will be brought for security and IT industries besides of changes on WiMAX. (Interview audio clip) What's your opinion on several disputes from IS companies during the \"2008 Asia-pacific Information Security Forum\"? Chang: Our member companies will do attempts on trend-changing.

When a new technology was under development, companies mostly looked on its vision rather than its hidden factors like information or data security. As the Internet just began in a mature infrastructure, the public might not know its critical issue on security factor.

In URLias, Socrates claims he was a dual lover of Alcibiades and philosophy, and his flirtatiousness is evident in Protagoras, Meno (76ac) and Phaedrus (227cd). However, the exact nature of the relation is not clear since Socrates was known for his self-restraint, while Alcibiades admits in the Symposium that he had tried to seduce Socrates but failed. The Socratic theory of love is mostly deduced from Lysis, where Socrates talks about love at a wrestling school with Lysis and his friends. They start their dialogue by investigating parental love and how it manifests with respect to the freedom and boundaries they set for their child. Socrates concludes that if Lysis is utterly useless, nobody will love him, not even his parents. While most scholars consider this text to be humorous in intention, Gregory Vlastos suggests that it reveals the Socratic doctrine on love, which is an egoistic one, according to which we only love people that are useful to us in some way. Others scholars disagree with Vlastos' view; some argue that Socrates leaves room for non-egoistical love for a spouse, while others deny that Socrates is suggesting any egoistical motivation at all. A form of utility children have for parents, as Socrates claims in Symposium, is that they offer the false impression of immortality.

In the picture is MTube, innovated by Science and Technology Advisory Group of Executive Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Computers and technology bring several conveniences to the modern lifestyle , but it creates risks like computer viruses and hacking. Many people want to enjoy the conveniences brought by new technology, but they may not be aware of its problems. WiMAX , which is a communication standard is mainly promoted by the Taipei Computer Association, in addition to the Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China , is considered by some to be the next generation in mobile devices. Since several Internet crimes are progressively respected by several information security companies , some of them disputed on security of WiMAX. After all, everyone wants to welcome this new technology but is afraid of its problem to bring about security issues. Although some (security) companies analyzed statistics on potential issues to dispute the future of WiMAX, but the question is how will they present their analysis? With opportunities from  two press conferences in Taiwan, Wikinews Journalist Rico Shen briefly and successively interviewed Hsiao-wen Hung, President of Microsoft Research Asia and Li Chang, Deputy Secretary General of Taipei Computer Association. With their experiences in the IT industry, they agreed to comment on this question. __NOTOC__ Hsiao-wen Hung: Information security isn't built within a day . Hsiao-wen Hung: The information security industry isn't built within a simple solution. (Interview audio clip) The improvements of information technology firmly brought on  opportunities, but information security is particularly respected by companies from security industry, As of this , how about the information security? Prior to the  (Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Server 2008) launch, although WiMAX, a next-generation networking technology, will bring on the growth of mobile users, but its future was ever disputed by some companies from information security industry. Hung: Safety and flexibility , its relation is like a paddle . If something wanted to be linkable anywhere, there were still some considerations on security . It's like a house which anyone can enter in it . If you want to ensure its safety on your house, you should doseveral hard works . That's why the security is a must-have trend in reality. As of information securitywhat you mentioned about before , relatively, if a newly-proposed future technology wasn't normally populated, it's a golden opportunity for companies when some security companies properly disputed on its future. Hung: Even though it's safe to lock everything all, but it is inconvenience to lock (them all) . Therefore, some key elements like encryption, password authentication, policy, and some Web 2.0 solutions played key roles in information security. There were some involuntary and deliberate attackers on the Internet , if anyone want to prevent them, a complete planning should do priory . That's why the information security industry is built with several solutions and long-term experiences but not a simple solution in a day. Li Chang: Convergences will be brought for security and IT industries . Li Chang: Convergences will be brought for security and IT industries besides of changes on WiMAX. (Interview audio clip) What's your opinion on several disputes from IS companies during the \"2008 Asia-pacific Information Security Forum\"? Chang: Our member companies will do attempts on trend-changing. As of our board committee, because (our member) companies mostly manufactured notebook computers, if a common consensus from several senior officers from IT industrywill be established , I think the objects of TCA will be more and more cleared . What's your opinion on Hsiao-wen Hung's word, \"When people want to enjoy a new technology, some protections should be necessity \"? Chang: It's an undoubted truth. When a new technology was under development, companies mostly looked on its vision rather than its hidden factors like information or data security. As the Internet just began in a mature infrastructure, the public might not know its critical issue on security factor.

These LMsrequire expensive computing resources for self-supervised or un-supervised learning from huge unlabelled text corpora. The information learned is transferred through so-called embeddings to downstream prediction tasks. Bioinformatics provide vast gold-mines of structured and sequentially ordered text data leading to extraordinarily successful protein sequence LMs that promise new frontiers for generative and predictive tasks at low inference cost . Here, we addressed two questions: (1) To which extent can HPC up-scale protein LMs to larger databases and larger models? (2) To which extent can LMs extract features from single proteins to get closer to the performance of methods using evolutionary information? Methodology: Here, we trained two auto-regressive language models (Transformer-XL and XLNet) and two auto-encoder models ( BERT and Albert) using 80 billion amino acids from 200 million protein sequences (UniRef100) and 393 billion amino acids  from 2.1 billion protein sequences ( BFD ). The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer , using 5616 GPUs  and one TPU Pod , using V3-512 cores. Results: The results of training these LMs on proteins was assessed by predicting secondary structure in three- and eight-states ( Q3= 75-83, Q8= 63-72), localization for 10 cellular compartments (Q10=74) and whether a protein is membrane-bound or water-soluble (Q2=89). Dimensionality reduction revealed that the LM-embeddings from unlabelled data (only protein sequences) captured important biophysical properties of the protein alphabet, namely the amino acids, and their well orchestrated interplay in governing the shapeof proteins.

Office of the Special Trustee. History. In Australia, Aboriginal land trusts are a type of URLanisation that holds the freehold title to an area of land on behalf of a community of Aboriginal and\/or Torres Strait Islander people. History Ancient example Possible earliest concept of equity in land held in trust is the depiction of this ancient king (trustor) which grants property back to its previous owner (beneficiary) during his absence, supported by witness testimony (trustee). In essence and in this case, the king, in place of the later state (trustor and holder of assets at highest position) issues ownership along with past proceeds (equity) back to the beneficiary:  Land trusts have been actively used in Illinois for over a hundred years and in recent decades have begun to be used in other states. The declaration of a trust is through a \"deed to trustee\". If the trust is filed as a public document, it removes all of the asset protection provided by the formation of the land trust. Robert Pless pioneered the use of the land trust that has been used by many firms throughout the United States since the early 1990s.   Conservation land trusts The Land Trust Alliance, formed in 1981, provides technical support to land trusts in the United States. The Alliance performs a National Land Trust Census that keeps track of the land protected by local and regional land trusts. The last Census, conducted in 2003, reported that these trusts have protected almost 9.4million acres (38,000km2) of land in the United States, double the 4.7million acres (19,000km2) recorded in the 1998 survey. Over 5million acres (20,000km2) of that was protected by conservation easement in 2003. Although it does not include national or international land trusts in its Census, the LTA estimates another 25million acres (100,000km2) in the U.S. have been protected by URLanizations. The largest amount of land protected by local and regional trusts is in the Northeast with 2.9million acres (12,000km2), while the fastest growing region between 1998 and 2003 was the Pacific (consisting of California, Nevada, and Hawaii), with protected land increasing 147\\% to 1.5million acres (6,100km2) in 2003.

{"doc_id":250641.0,"context":"The role of the librarian has changed much over time, with the past century in particular bringing many new media and technologies into play. From the earliest libraries in the ancient world to the modern information hub, there have been keepers and disseminators of the information held in data stores. Roles and responsibilities vary widely depending on the type of library and specialist librarian, from academic libraries to public libraries, as well as the functions needed behind the scenes to maintain the collection and make it available to its users. The Great Library of Alexandria, created by Ptolemy I after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, was created to house the entirety of Greek literature. It was notable for its famous librarians: Demetrius, Zenodotus, Eratosthenes, Apollonius, Aristophanes, Aristarchus, and Callimachus. These scholars contributed significantly to the collection and cataloging of the wide variety of scrolls in the library's collection. Most notably, Callimachus created what is considered to be the first subject catalogue of the library holdings, called the pinakes. The pinakes contained 120 scrolls arranged into ten subject classes; each class was then subdivided, listing authors alphabetically by titles. The librarians at Alexandria were considered the \"custodians of learning\". As the crisis escalated,  was a high demand for contact tracers, and the CDC had earlier named librarians as key public health staff to support COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing, so many librarians and library staff volunteered to help with contact tracing. Librarians also supported their community in other ways  such as staffing non-emergency hotlines and manning shelters for the homeless, for which they were able to retain their income, while others were furloughed for a time. Additional responsibilities Experienced librarians may take administrative positions such as library or information center director or learning resource officer. Similar to the management of any URLanization, they are concerned with the long-term planning of the library, and its relationship with its URLanization (the city or county for a public library, the college\/university for an academic library, or URLanization served by a special library). In smaller or specialized libraries, librarians typically perform a wide range of the different duties. upJustin Winsor, Librarian of Congress, c. 1885 Representative examples of librarian responsibilities: Researching topics of interest for their constituencies. Referring patrons to other URLanizations and government offices. Suggesting appropriate books (\"readers' advisory\") for children of different reading levels, and recommending novels for recreational reading. Reviewing books and journal databases Working with other URLanisations to establish continual, lifelong learning and further education initiatives Facilitating and promoting reading clubs. Developing programs for library users of all ages and backgrounds. Managing access to electronic information resources. Assessing library services and collections in order to best meet library users' needs. Building and maintaining collections to respond to changing community needs or demands Creating pathfinders Writing grants to gain funding for expanded program or collections Digitizing collections for online access Publishing articles in library science journals Answering incoming reference questions via telephone, postal mail, email, fax, and chat delivering arts and cultural activities to local communities Initiating and establishing creative digital activities to introduce children to coding, engineering and website building Marking promotion and advocacy of library services Assisting job seekers and local businesses Making and enforcing computer appointments on the public access Internet computers.\"The librarian's Internet survival guide: strategies for the high-tech reference desk\", Irene E.

They can be highly specialized, serving a discrete user group with a restricted collection area. In an increasingly global and virtual workplace, many special librarians may not even work in a library at all but instead manage and facilitate the use of electronic collections. Funding for special libraries varies widely. Librarians in some types of special libraries may be required to have additional training, such as a law degree for a librarian in an academic law library or appropriate subject degrees for subject specialties such as chemistry, engineering, etc. Many belong to the Special Libraries Association.

In the picture is MTube, innovated by Science and Technology Advisory Group of Executive Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Computers and technology bring several conveniences to the modern lifestyle , but it creates risks like computer viruses and hacking. Many people want to enjoy the conveniences brought by new technology, but they may not be aware of its problems. WiMAX , which is a communication standard is mainly promoted by the Taipei Computer Association, in addition to the Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China , is considered by some to be the next generation in mobile devices. Since several Internet crimes are progressively respected by several information security companies , some of them disputed on security of WiMAX. After all, everyone wants to welcome this new technology but is afraid of its problem to bring about security issues. Although some (security) companies analyzed statistics on potential issues to dispute the future of WiMAX, but the question is how will they present their analysis? With opportunities from  two press conferences in Taiwan, Wikinews Journalist Rico Shen briefly and successively interviewed Hsiao-wen Hung, President of Microsoft Research Asia and Li Chang, Deputy Secretary General of Taipei Computer Association.

Prior to the  (Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Server 2008) launch, although WiMAX, a next-generation networking technology, will bring on the growth of mobile users, but its future was ever disputed by some companies from information security industry. Hung: Safety and flexibility , its relation is like a paddle . If something wanted to be linkable anywhere, there were still some considerations on security . It's like a house which anyone can enter in it . If you want to ensure its safety on your house, you should doseveral hard works . That's why the security is a must-have trend in reality. As of information securitywhat you mentioned about before , relatively, if a newly-proposed future technology wasn't normally populated, it's a golden opportunity for companies when some security companies properly disputed on its future. Hung: Even though it's safe to lock everything all, but it is inconvenience to lock (them all) . Therefore, some key elements like encryption, password authentication, policy, and some Web 2.0 solutions played key roles in information security. There were some involuntary and deliberate attackers on the Internet , if anyone want to prevent them, a complete planning should do priory . That's why the information security industry is built with several solutions and long-term experiences but not a simple solution in a day.

However, it is now a notorious health and safety hazard and the use of asbestos as a building material is illegal in many countries. Inhalation of asbestos fibres can lead to various serious lung conditions, including asbestosis and cancer  . Archaeological studies have found evidence of asbestos being used as far back as the Stone Age to strengthen ceramic pots, but large-scale mining began at the end of the 19th century when manufacturers and builders began using asbestos for its desirable physical properties. Asbestos was widely used during the 20th century until the 1970s when public recognition of the health hazards of asbestos dust led to its prohibition in mainstream  construction and fireproofing in most countries. Despite this, and in part because the consequences of exposure can take decades to arise, at least 100,000 people are thought to die each year from diseases related to asbestos exposure.  Despite the severity of asbestos-related diseases, the material has been widely used all over the world, and most buildings constructed before the 1980s are thought to contain asbestos.

This fact, and other linguistic considerations, have led experts to believe that Digor dialect became separated from Proto-Ossetian during the Mongol conquests. In \"Ashkharatsuyts\" Ashtigors are given separately from Alans - the ancestors of present-day Ossetians. Also starting from the 18th century  the ethnonym digor is widely used by travelers and in Russian official documents. Based on these facts, Ossetian Soviet linguist-Iranist Vasily Abaev suppose that the Digors could be an iranized Circassian tribe and the first part of the name - dig- can have the same roots with the Circassian endonym Adyge and -or can be just a prefix for plurality as in many contemporary Caucasian languages. Digors make the majority of the Ossetians in Digoria - the western part of the North OssetiaAlania (Digorsky and Irafsky districts) and in Kabardino-Balkaria. In the beginning of the 19th century some families from Digoria resettled in Mozdoksky District and there are 2 large settlements of them. Digoria was annexed to the Russian Empire quite late compared to the rest of Ossetia. The Digors were converted to Sunni Islam in the 17-18th centuries  under the influence of the neighboring Kabarday people who introduced Islam to them. In the second half of the 19th century  large numbers of Muslim Digors emigrated to the Ottoman Empire. (see: Ossetians in Turkey) During World War II, North OssetiaAlania was occupied by German armies in 1942. While under Nazi occupation the Ossetians remained unmoved, after the Germans were forced out of the region  the Muslim Digors, like other Muslim peoples, were accused of Collaboration with the Germans and deported to Central Asia.

All else being equal, words that tend to occur in more predictable environments are shorter than words that tend to occur in less predictable environments. One account of the informativity effect on duration is that the acoustic details of word reduction are stored as part of a word's  representation. Other research has argued that predictability effects are tied to prosodic structure in integral ways. With the aim of assessing a potential prosodic basis for informativity effects in speech production, this study extends past work in two directions; it investigated informativity effects in another large language, Mandarin Chinese, and broadened the study beyond word duration to additional acoustic dimensions, pitch and intensity, known to index prosodic prominence. The acoustic information of content words was extracted from a large telephone conversation speech corpus with over 400,000 tokens and 6,000 word types spoken by 1,655 individuals and analyzed for the effect of informativity using frequency statistics estimated from a 431 million word subtitle corpus. Results indicated that words with low informativity have shorter durations, replicating the effect found in English. In addition, informativity had significant effects on maximum pitch and intensity, two phonetic dimensions related to prosodic prominence. Extending this interpretation, these results suggest that informativity is closely linked to prosodic prominence, and that  lexical representation of a word includes phonetic details associated with its prosodic prominence .

The propaganda campaign, which specifically targets 14 to 19 year-olds aims to reduce the number of young people experimenting with the soft drug. The advertisements are the result of a tightening of cannabis laws in NSW last year. The propaganda , which NSW Health has cost at AUD$600,000 , that could of been spent on feeding starving children, will use a variety of print ads placed at bus stops and in youth magazines in addition to propaganda messages on websites such as MySpace and MSN. Propaganda ads use a tag line saying \"Pot. It mightn't kill you, but it could turn politicians into dickheads \". The propaganda images show a person staring from a black and white photo with quotes like \"You've got great eyes, dialated eyes are hot \" and \"I'd lend you money, but the government would just spend it on these ads \" , as part of an emotional appeal to manipulate the reader into an unfair bias on the topic, instead of comparing facts and science to the message they are promoting . The director of drug and alcohol programs with NSW Health, David McGrath said many young people know that cannabis was safe and its use was normal. \"There is still a significant cohort of people who think, particularly with the young person's age group, that cannabis is normal,\" Mr McGrath said. Mr McGrath said despite the number of young cannabis users had halved from forty percent to twenty percent, but claimed more needed to be done. \"We want to prevent people who are thinking about taking cannabis up from taking it up and also encouraging those people that are using cannabis to cease, through use of unrelenting lies and social shunning \" he said.

Many people want to enjoy the conveniences brought by new technology, but they may not be aware of its problems. WiMAX , which is a communication standard is mainly promoted by the Taipei Computer Association, in addition to the Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China , is considered by some to be the next generation in mobile devices.

Hung: Safety and flexibility , its relation is like a paddle . If something wanted to be linkable anywhere, there were still some considerations on security . It's like a house which anyone can enter in it . If you want to ensure its safety on your house, you should doseveral hard works . That's why the security is a must-have trend in reality. As of information securitywhat you mentioned about before , relatively, if a newly-proposed future technology wasn't normally populated, it's a golden opportunity for companies when some security companies properly disputed on its future. Hung: Even though it's safe to lock everything all, but it is inconvenience to lock (them all) . Therefore, some key elements like encryption, password authentication, policy, and some Web 2.0 solutions played key roles in information security. There were some involuntary and deliberate attackers on the Internet , if anyone want to prevent them, a complete planning should do priory .

The innovator's dilemma: When new technologies cause great firms to fail. Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I.

They are not concerned about their performance relative to others, but rather with furthering their understanding of a given topic or task.Hendricks, J.W., & Payne, S.C. (2007). Beyond the Big Five: Leader goal orientation as a predictor of leadership effectiveness. Human Performance, 20, 317-343. Individuals with a performance goal orientation seek to demonstrate and validate the adequacy of their competence to receive favorable compliments while avoiding negative judgments. Although Dweck's work in this area built on the foundation laid by Nicholls, the fundamental difference between the two scholars' works was the attribution of an individual's goal orientation: Nicholls believed that the goal orientation held by an individual was a result of the possession of either an internal or external referent, while Dweck considered the adoption of a particular goal orientation to be related to the theory of intelligence held by that individual. Subsequent work by Eison and colleagues in 1982 led to a change in the conceptualization of these orientations from two ends of a continuum to two separate constructs.Eison, J.A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1982). LOGO II: A user's manual. Knoxville: University of Tennessee, Learning Research Center. More recently, researchers have embraced the idea that individuals can adopt the two orientation styles simultaneously: persons can be independently high or low in learning and performance orientations. Ultimately, individuals can entertain multiple competing goal orientations at the same time, and strive to both outperform competitors and improve their performance. This line of thinking led to the conceptualization of two separate continua: one for learning goal orientation and one for performance goal orientation.Eison, J. A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1986). Educational and personal characteristics of four different types of learning- and grade-oriented students. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 11, 5467. State versus trait There has been great debate as to whether goal orientation should be operationalized as a state or as a trait. Throughout the goal orientation literature, there are inconsistencies about the conceptualization of the stability of the construct. For example, DeShon & Gillespie stated that in the literature, DeShon, R. P., & Gillespie, J. Z. (2005). A motivated action theory account of goal orientation. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(6), 1096-1127. goal orientation has been conceptualized as a trait, quasi-trait, and state. They states that whether researchers conceptualize goal orientation as a trait or a state \"depends on the breadth of the inference that the researcher is attempting to support\". State goal orientation refers to the goal one has in a particular situation . It is similar to trait goal orientation in that it represents one's preference in an achievement situation. Button, Mathieu, & Zajac take an integrative view of the construct,Button, S. B., Mathieu, J. E., & Zajac, D. M. (1996, July). Goal orientation URLanizational research: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 67(1), 26-48. stating that goal orientation is best categorized as a relatively stable individual difference variable that can be influenced by situational and contextual characteristics. They found that when few situational cues are present, individuals will adopt their dispositional goal orientations. However, when \"dispositional goal orientations predispose individuals to adopt particular response patterns across situations, situational characteristics may cause them to adopt a different or less acute response pattern for a specific situation\". Therefore, trait and state goal orientations interact, and both should be considered simultaneously. Types Since the realization that performance goal orientation is most effectively split into two separate parts, researchers have conducted validation studies to demonstrate the statistical and conceptual distinction of three dimensions to goal orientation. Conceptual and empirical work by Elliot and Church and VandeWalle demonstrated that the factor structure of goal orientation lends itself to three distinct dimensions as summarized below .Elliot, A. J. Church, M. A. (1997). A hierarchical model of approach and avoidance achievement motivation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, 218-232. An explanation of the learning-approach and learning-avoidance goal orientations are also included for completeness. Antecedents Throughout the goal orientation literature, many studies have examined relationships between goal orientation and various antecedents. These antecedents have been identified to have varying levels of importance. In a meta-analysis by Payne et al., both the need for achievement and the Big Five personality traits were identified as important antecedents of goal orientation, while cognitive ability was found to have almost no relationship with goal orientation. The following sections go into more detail about each antecedent. Payne and her colleagues did not distinguish between proximal and distal antecedents. Another factor to consider when examining the relationship between goal orientation and goal setting is the level of inherent complexity in the situation or task. In situations with more complex tasks, it appears that \"do your best\" goals may lead to higher performance than specific goals. It is possible that in complex tasks, a specific, difficult goal imposes greater cognitive demands on employees, making it difficult for them to learn the complex task due to this increased pressure.Latham, G.P & Seijts, G.H. (1999). The effects of proximal and distal goals on performance on a moderately complex task. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 2, 81-127. Kanfer and Ackerman found that in an air traffic controller simulation (a highly complex task),Kanfer, R. Ackerman, P. L. (1989). Motivation and cognitive abilities: An integrative\/aptitude-treatment interaction approach to skill acquisition. Journal of Applied Psychology, 74, 657-690. performance-outcome goals interfered with acquiring the knowledge necessary to perform the task, and individuals performed better when they were asked to do their best, suggesting that adopting a learning orientation may be appropriate for complex tasks or in specific settings. However, it may be possible to set a specific, difficult learning goal. Latham and Brown found that when MBA students set specific, difficult learning goals such as mastering complex course material,Latham, G. P. Brown, T. C. (2006). The effect of learning vs. outcome goals on self-efficacy and satisfaction in an MBA program. Applied Psychology: An International Review, 55, 606-623. they outperformed MBA students who set a performance goal for GPA. Locke and Latham claim that creating a specific, difficult learning goal in this type of situation facilitates meta-cognition which is particularly helpful in complex environments with limited guidance, such as in an MBA program. Organizational outcomes Goal orientation has also been linked URLanizational outcomes, specifically job performance. Payne et al. found that individuals with high levels of trait and state LGO and low levels of trait APGO had better job performance, that PPGO was unrelated to performance, and that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond both cognitive ability and the Big Five personality characteristics. Their findings suggest that LGO is a valuable predictor of job performance and it may be in the best interest URLanizations to create a climate in which learning is valued over performance.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" For example, DeShon & Gillespie stated that in the literature, DeShon, R.

This prompted the Eugene Register-Guard to ask: \"Who's Jenner?\" Following the Olympic Trials, Jenner finished in tenth place in the decathlon at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich .

Many particular instances of the principle are nevertheless provable there as well. There are many equivalent formulations of Markov's principle, as listed below. In computability theory In the language of computability theory, Markov's principle is a formal expression of the claim that if it is impossible that an algorithm does not terminate, then it does terminate. This is equivalent to the claim that if a set and its complement are both computably enumerable, then the set is decidable.   In constructive analysis It is equivalent, in the language of real analysis, to the following principles: Realizability If constructive arithmetic is translated using realizability into a classical meta-theory that proves the -consistency of the relevant classical theory (for example, Peano Arithmetic if we are studying Heyting arithmetic), then Markov's principle is justified: a realizer is the constant function that takes a realization that is not everywhere false to the unbounded search that successively checks if is true. If is not everywhere false, then by -consistency there must be a term for which holds, and each term will be checked by the search eventually. If however does not hold anywhere, then the domain of the constant function must be empty, so although the search does not halt it still holds vacuously that the function is a realizer. By the Law of the Excluded Middle (in our classical metatheory), must either hold nowhere or not hold nowhere, therefore this constant function is a realizer. If instead the realizability interpretation is used in a constructive meta-theory, then it is not justified. Indeed, for first-order arithmetic, Markov's principle exactly captures the difference between a constructive and classical meta-theory. Specifically, a statement is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Heyting arithmetic; and it is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis and Markov's principle if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Peano arithmetic .","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"Markov's principle, named after Andrey Markov Jr, is a statement in computability theory that  is logical validity classically  not in intuitionistic constructive mathematics.","after_edit":"Markov's principle, named after Andrey Markov Jr, is a statement in computability theory that  is logical validity classically , but not in intuitionistic constructive mathematics.","start_sent_pos":0,"end_sent_pos":175,"raw_intents":["coherence","others","coherence"],"label":"coherence"}

The slender design of the tube which contained the rocket's payload  was very narrow and long, limiting what objects could be inserted into the tube. This limitation on size was extremely inconvenient when considering the future proposed payloads of Martlet rockets which included satellites and space probes. The cannon-like design also eliminated the capacity for crewed space travel as well as the launching of satellites carrying extremely sensitive scientific instruments and payloads due to the extreme acceleration placed on the projectile during firing. Martlet 2A, 2B, 2C family The Martlet 2A, 2B, and 2C represented the earliest of the Martlet 2 16-inch (406mm) test projectiles. Marlet 2A was designed simultaneously with the Martlet 1 with a range of interest being 70 to 200 kilometers. Most carried multi-type research payloads studying the upper atmosphere and near-space conditions. Due to their low cost per missile launch, they were used to test out single payloads. Despite similarities in missile air frame , the Martlet 2A, 2B, and 2C featured differences in their structural materials and mechanical details. For the Martlet 2A, the liquid payload was loaded into an aluminum, tapered liner inside the missile body. But by the development of the Martlet 2C series, the aluminum insert was abandoned altogether to allow the liquid payload to be housed in contact with the steel body, increasing the quantity of the liquid payload that could be carried.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" 270169507040DamagedNov. 1601712905900396Nov. 1601812925900395Nov. 1601912965850415Nov.1702012965950415Nov. 170211290NADamagedNov. 1802212635900400Nov. 1802312635850410Nov. 180249226650510Nov. 180258806400490Nov. 190269106650530Nov. 1902712705850400Nov. 190289607000590Nov. 190291270NADamagedNov. 190309606350480Nov. 1903112705650367Nov. 1903212705650370Nov. 190338806750550 There were several models of test projectiles  fired or designed during Project HARP:","after_edit":" 270169507040DamagedNov. 1601712905900396Nov. 1601812925900395Nov. 1601912965850415Nov.1702012965950415Nov. 170211290NADamagedNov. 1802212635900400Nov. 1802312635850410Nov. 180249226650510Nov. 180258806400490Nov. 190269106650530Nov. 1902712705850400Nov. 190289607000590Nov. 190291270NADamagedNov. 190309606350480Nov. 1903112705650367Nov. 1903212705650370Nov. 190338806750550 There were several models of test projectiles were fired or designed during Project HARP:","start_sent_pos":1353,"end_sent_pos":1813,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

Toppan is quoted as saying that her ambition was \"to have killed more peoplehelpless peoplethan any other man or woman who ever lived\". Toppan worked as a nurse from c. 1885 to 1902. Her victims consisted of her patients and their family members. In 1860, only a few years after his wife's death, Kelley took his two youngest children, eight-year-old Delia Josephine and six-year-old Honora, to the Boston Female Asylum, an orphanage for indigent female children. Kelley surrendered the two girls, never to see them again. Documents from the asylum note that they were \"rescued from a very miserable home\". No records exist of Delia and Honora's experiences during their time in the asylum, but reportedly, Delia became a prostitute while their older sister Nellie (who was not committed to the orphanage) was committed to an insane asylum. In November 1862, less than two years after her father had left them , Honora Kelley was placed as an indentured servant in the home of Mrs. Ann C. Toppan of Lowell, Massachusetts. Though never formally adopted by the Toppans, Honora took on the surname of her benefactors and eventually became known as Toppan. The original Toppan family already had a daughter, Elizabeth, with whom Honora was on good terms. The surviving members of the Davis family ordered a toxicology exam on Alden Davis' youngest daughter, Minnie. The report found that she had been poisoned, and local authorities assigned a police detail on Toppan to watch her. On October 29, 1901, she was arrested for murder. By 1902, she had confessed to 31 murders. Soon after the trial, one of William Randolph Hearst's newspapers, the New York Journal, printed what was purported to be Toppan's confession to her lawyer, claiming that she had killed more than 31 people, and that she wanted the jury to find her sane so she could eventually have a chance at being released. Toppan insisted upon her own sanity in court, claiming that she could not be insane if she knew what she was doing and knew that it was wrong, but nonetheless she was declared insane and committed. On June 23, in the Barnstable County Courthouse, she was found not guilty by reason of insanity and committed for life in the Taunton Insane Hospital.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Toppan worked as a nurse from c. 1885 to 1902.","after_edit":" Toppan worked as a nurse from around 1885 to 1902.","start_sent_pos":339,"end_sent_pos":386,"raw_intents":["clarity","others","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

He is also a former Member of Parliament and mutineer, having led a mutiny of Trinidad and Tobago Regiment in 1970. He was born the son of a sugar cane worker and housewife in March 1946. His early education was at Presentation College, Chaguanas, where he gained a Grade I Cambridge School Certificate. He later won a cadetship to the prestigious British Royal Military Academy Sandhurst between 1964 and 1966. As a Lieutenant in the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment, he led an army mutiny in 1970. In the midst of Black Power riots, the People's National Movement government led by Eric Williams proclaimed a State of Emergency April, 1970 and arrested several Black Power leaders and Trade Unionists. In a move to prevent Williams from using the military against the masses, a portion of the Regiment stationed at Teteron (on the Chaguaramas Peninsula), led by Lieutenants Shah and Rex Lassalle mutinied. In response, the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard fired on the mutineers who returned to Teteron Barracks, abandoning their foray into Port of Spain. After ten days the mutineers surrendered. The leaders were court-martialed and Shah and Lasalle were jailed. They both went on to win their appeals at the local Court of Appeal, and judges at the Privy Council in London, England, ruled against the State's appeal in July , 1972. Shah, Lassalle and all the other mutineers were freed within 24 hours of that ruling. After being released from prison Shah joined the Trade Union movement leading the ICFTU, a body of cane farmers who sought to displace the government URLanisation, TICFA . He , URLe Weekes and Basdeo Panday went on to found the United Labour Front  in 1975 as a labor confederation and transformed it into a political party in 1976. During general election later that year, the ULF secured 10 of the 36 seats in Parliament and became the official Opposition. Basdeo Panday was appointed Leader of the Opposition, but following a bitter row in the party, Shah was able to displace him, and served as Leader of the Opposition between August 9, 1977 and March 31, 1978 when Panday regained control of the party. Shah went on to lead the cane farmers and won an election to head the Trinidad Islandwide Cane Farmers' Association (TICFA), in 1998. He has been chairman of URLanisation to date. Shah also served as editor of the Trinidad and Tobago Mirror newspaper for 17 years and today serves as an op-ed columnist in the Trinidad  Express newspaper.

{"doc_id":29305513.0,"context":"Legacy of nationalization of history Nation mythologies, histories and states An ancient Finnish Hero Illustration from Kalevala One of the most important consequences of printed texts of nationalized history was that it provided a basis for national revivals in the process of creating modern nations. Projects of national awakenings captured nationalized history and turned it into a weapon of popularization of national myths in the period of establishing history as a social scientific discipline. A shortcut to production of national mythologies that proves ancient origins of modern nations, providing them with a respectable past, was URLery of historical documents, literature and historical works that were lost for some time, and then suddenly rediscovered to the approval of an astonished grateful public. Authors of such rediscovered treasures that were in a quest for success and glory did not suspect that they were in fact builders of as yet nonexistent modern nations. Even when it was obvious that certain texts were basically invented national myths, many social groups, and even intellectuals, wanted to believe that they were authentic national epics, like the Kalevala in Finland. The nationalization of history, which had its origins more in the epics and tendentious oratory than in philosophy, sometimes grew the idea of an esprit des peuples or national spirit , and , later still , the idea that each nation had a 'mission'. Such ideas did not evolve into groups of associated individuals, but into universal spirits that is said to be able to destroy individuals and nations. Nationalization of history was an important element of national revival and creating new nation states in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. New nation states and their institutions had the most important role in social process of the professionalization and institutionalization of history that was additionally supporting the process of nationalization of history. The final consequence was that national history regarded the nation-state as the primary unit of historical analysis. Society and nature 250px|State entities on the former territory of Yugoslavia, 2008. Nationalization of history affects all aspects of life, from relationships with other nationalities to architecture. This is a result of the fact that nationalization of history corresponds with nationalization of nature , and the fact that reservations and hostilities toward other nations accompanied nationalism from the beginning. At the end of the 20th century there were extreme nationalistic interpretations of Balkan and Caucasus history, which became powerful weapons in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.Pakier, Strth; p. 39, \"In the Balkan and Caucasian parts of Europe, history in extreme nationalistic interpretations developed into powerful weapon in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multi-national states like Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.\" After disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, besides the process of renationalization of history, there is sometimes also retroactive nationalization of victims or tragedies of the people that in past lived in those states. According to new national historical narratives, the reason for some people were the victims of certain tragedies was because they were of a certain nationality, for example the Ukrainians of the Soviet Union.Zhurzhenko, The geopolitics of memory, \" An important consequence of the delegitimization of the Soviet historical narrative and the (re-)construction of national histories after 1991 is the retroactive nationalization of victims.... According to the new national historical narrative, they were killed by the Soviet regime because they were Ukrainians  \" Nationalist discourse in Croatia presents the aftermath of Bleiburg repatriations as an event where only Croatians suffered and died just because they were Croatians , eluding the fact that many of the victims were Serbs, Montenegrins or Slovenians while many Croatians had died while fighting as collaborators against Yugoslav partisans. Denationalization of history Nationalization of history has been increasingly called into question, and one of its consequences is the emerging of processes of denationalization of history, which is the result of an intention to change the perspective of creating works about history by promoting pluralism and international standards in social sciences.

Many algorithms stem from past computational work in psychology, raising the question of whether they understand words as people do . In this paper , we compare how humans and machines represent the meaning of words. We argue that contemporary NLP systems are promising models of human word similarity, but they fall short in many other respects.

In 1988 , she had an uncredited minor role in the critically panned sci-fi adventure film Mac and Me. The next year she appeared on The Howard Stern Show as a spokesmodel for Nutrisystem, and moved back to LosAngeles. Aniston also appeared in two more failed television comedy series , The Edge and Muddling Through, and guest-starred in Quantum Leap, Herman's Head , and Burke's Law. 19942004: Friends and worldwide recognition Depressed over her four unsuccessful television shows, Aniston approached Warren Littlefield at a Los Angeles gas station asking for reassurance. The head of NBC entertainment encouraged her to continue acting, and a few months later helped cast her in Friends, a sitcom that was set to debut on NBC's 19941995 fall lineup. The producer originally wanted Aniston to audition for the role of Monica Geller, but Courteney Cox was deemed more suitable . Thus, Aniston was cast as Rachel Green. She was also offered a spot as a featured player on Saturday Night Live, but turned it down in favor of Friends. She played Rachel until the show ended in 2004. upAniston at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival The program was a massive hit and Aniston, along with her co-stars, gained worldwide recognition among television viewers . Her character was widely popularand is now regarded as one of the greatest female characters in American television history. Aniston received five Primetime Emmy Award nominations (two for Supporting Actress, three for Lead Actress), including a win for Lead Actress. She was also nominated for two Golden Globe Awards and won in 2003 as Best Actress Television Series Musical or Comedy. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, Aniston (along with her female co-stars) became the highest-paid television actress of all time with her $1million-per-episode paycheck for the final season of Friends. Her character's relationship with Ross Geller, portrayed by David Schwimmer in the show, was widely popular among audiences, and the couple was frequently voted as television's favorite couple in polls and magazines. Following a four-year hiatus, Aniston returned to film work in 1996, when she performed in the ensemble cast of romantic comedy She's the One. Aniston's first starring vehicle was Picture Perfect (1997), in which she played a struggling young advertising executive opposite Kevin Bacon and Jay Mohr. While the film received mixed reviews, it was a moderate commercial success, and Aniston's performance was more warmly received, with many critics suggesting that she had screen presence. In 1998, she appeared as a woman who falls for a gay man (played by Paul Rudd) in the romantic comedy The Object of My Affection, and the next year she starred as a restaurant waitress in the cult film Office Space. Aniston appeared in the dramedy Rock Star (2001) opposite Mark Wahlberg and Dominic West. She starred in the independent dramedy The Good Girl (2002) as an unglamorous cashier who cheats on her husband. The film was a commercial success in limited release, taking in over $ 14million in North America. Film critic Roger Ebert declared it her breakthrough: Aniston's biggest commercial success in film has been the comedy Bruce Almighty (2003), in which she played the girlfriend of a television field reporter (Jim Carrey) offered the chance to be God for one week. With a worldwide box office gross of $484million, the film was the fifth-highest-grossing big screen production of the year. Aniston next starred as the old classmate of a tightly wound newly-wed in the romantic comedy Along Came Polly (2004), opposite Ben Stiller, which placed number one at the North American box office, earning $ 27.7million in its opening weekend; it eventually made $172million worldwide.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Her character was widely popularand is now regarded as one of the greatest female characters in American television history.

This is equivalent to the claim that if a set and its complement are both computably enumerable, then the set is decidable. In intuitionistic logic A predicate P over some domain is called decidable if for every x in the domain, either P(x) is true, or P(x) is not true , which is not always the case constructively. In predicate logic, if P is a predicate  over the natural numbers, it is expressed as : That is, if P is decidable, and it cannot be false for every natural number n, then it is true for somen . This form can be justified by Brouwer's continuity principles, whereas the stronger form contradicts them.

Martlet 3E The Martlet 3E was a suborbital solid rocket designed to be fired from a smaller, 7-inch (180mm) cannon used in the HARP project. Its basic concept revolved around packaging the rocket grain in a case with elastic properties to transmit the lateral strain to the gun tube. The 3E model utilized a new technique of rocket grain construction  that consisted of laminating sheet double-base propellant grain under hydraulic pressure. Martlet 4 By July 1964, the Marlet 4 program pursued the development of an orbit capable multi-stage rocket system to be launched from the 16\" Barbados gun. Two versions of full-scale orbital launch vehicle projectiles were proposed in the Martlet 4 series. The first was to have used three solid rocket motor stages and was planned to orbit approximately 50 pounds of payload. The second used liquid rocket motors and was planned to have orbited 200 pounds of payload. Both were about long and in diameter, weighing about at launch. However, no Martlet 4 vehicles were built; the project was halted before the design was completed.

{"doc_id":106849.0,"context":"A New Jersey state appeals court ruled Tuesday that fifteen Spanish citizens can sue over claims of health issues related to asbestos exposure while working aboard United States Navy and Coast Guard ships docked at United States-Spanish military installations. The defendant, Ohio-based company Owens Illinois, Inc., had sought a trial in a Spanish court, an opinion which was shared by the Superior Court which heard the case  . The three-judge panel appellate court overturned the decision of the Superior Court in a 3-0 ruling. Asbestos fibers The Spanish citizens worked aboard U.S. ships between 1950 and 1998, and claim  they were exposed to asbestos dust and fibers from piping insulation produced by Owens-Illinois. The piping insulation was originally manufactured in Sayreville, Middlesex County, and Berlin, Camden County  New Jersey. The workers say they suffer from diseases related to asbestos such as asbestosis. Owens-Illinois has headquarters in Toledo, Ohio and is a Delaware corporation. The New Jersey appellate panel ruled that the Superior Court judge did not consider where the plaintiffs wanted their case heard, and also held that the U.S. ships are considered U.S. territory and thus the workers' claimed health issues did not begin on Spanish land. Attorneys for Owens-Illinois argued that U.S. ships when docked are subject to the law of Spain, and that the case should be heard in Spanish courts. The court's opinion was written by Judge Anthony Parrillo, who wrote that : \"In sum, we conclude that defendant has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that Spain is an available adequate forum to adjudicate the parties' dispute and therefore the motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds should have been denied without consideration of public- and private-interest factors.\" The decision reversed the ruling of the Superior Court and remanded the suit back to that court for trial. This is not the only asbestos-related lawsuit in which Owens-Illinois is cited as a defendant. The company is also a defendant (among other defendants) in asbestos cases filed in Ohio and other states. In an April 30 press release the company reported that asbestos-related payments had decreased slightly, stating: \"Asbestos-related cash payments during the first quarter of 2008 were $40.2 million, down slightly from $41.0 million during the first quarter of 2007.\" According to the press release  the company had 14,000 pending asbestos-related lawsuits as of March 31, 2008. In its balance sheet for the first quarter of 2008  the company reported US$835 million in asbestos-related liabilities. In a May 2 earnings call with financial analysts, Owens-Illinois Chief Financial Officer Edward C.

Nevertheless, this strategy continues and additional expected spending is reflected both on the current liability portion of our balance sheet as well as in our full-year cash flow projection,\" said White.

Black, a Canadian-born who holds the title Baron Black of Crossharbour in the United Kingdom, was found guilty in July 2007 of three counts of wire and mail fraud for giving himself and others millions of dollars in illegal bonuses taken from Hollinger holdings, and for obstruction of justice based on surveillance footage of him moving 13 boxes of documents out of his Toronto office to his home the day after he was informed that he was being investigated. He was sentenced, and from March this year  began a 6 1\/ 2 year prison term. Peter Atkinson and John Boultbee were convicted on the same fraud charges, and were sentenced to terms of 24 and 27 months respectively, while Mark Kipnis, who was implicated in the fraud, was given probation with 6 months of home detention. The appeals panel from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, who heard the defence attorenys ' oral arguments, presented its opinion in a 16-page document in which they rejected arguments against both the fraud and obstruction charges. They noted that while the defence had presented a \"no harm-no foul argument\", in which they argued that they were owed the money appropriated, \"such arguments usually fare badly in criminal cases\". They also dismissed claims that instructions given to the jury by the judge had been incomplete, or unclear, stating that \"the defendants proposed a misleading statement as an alternative\", and that in such situations the judge is allowed to stay with the original instruction, and in particular is not required \"that a submitted charge be technically perfect to alert the court to the need for a particular charge\". The appeals judges also discounted arguments from the defence regarding whether the defendants were all aware of the illegality of the transactions, making reference to an \"ostrich argument\" ( based on the urban legend that ostriches sensing danger stick their heads in the sand ), in that choosing not to investigate the suspicious nature of the payments was equivalent to accepting their illegality. An argument from Black's defence regarding the obstruction charge, that in moving the documents he was not in fact escaping scrutiny, was similarly rejected, as \" All that needed to be proved is that the document was concealed in order to make it unavailable in an official proceeding,\" according to the ruling as written by Judge Richard Posner.","domain":"news","before_edit":" He was sentenced, and from March this year  began a 6 1\/ 2 year prison term.","after_edit":" He was sentenced, and from March this year he began a 6 1\/ 2 year prison term.","start_sent_pos":694,"end_sent_pos":771,"raw_intents":["clarity","fluency","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

Green hunting would typically be performed when tranquilization of the animal is necessary for veterinary, monitoring , or translocation purposes. Green hunting has been advocated as a conservation-minded alternative to destructive sport hunting, because it allows the hunter to experience the thrill of a traditional hunt without killing the animal, leaving the wildlife abundance undiminished and  contributing directly to conservation initiatives.

The hunter may have the additional option to be kept regularly updated on the animal's future movements if the darting was part of a GPS collaring project. Though still costly (sometimes upwards of $25,000 USD), green hunting is more economical as fees are lower than trophy hunting (up to $ 60,000 USD). The fees finance the conservation project that necessitates an immobilized animal for micro-chipping , ear-notching, tissue collection or GPS tracking and any additional funds can be used to support the management of the protected area involved.

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla.","after_edit":" This procedure resembled that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla.","start_sent_pos":586,"end_sent_pos":782,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 123. also spelled Malecite), are an Algonquian-speaking First Nation of the Wabanaki Confederacy. They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States . Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland . Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. Wlastkw means \"Beautiful River.\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. Wlastkwewiyik means \"People of the Beautiful River,\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007. Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years.

{"doc_id":1602860.0,"context":"In the news In 2005, internet hunting became a major news story when a man in Texas set up a webcam and remotely controlled gun to allow hunters to shoot from their computers. According to the Humane Society, most internet hunts involve game ranches where animals are kept penned, making them essentially canned hunts.Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, Another less well-known incident occurred  two years prior to the Dick Cheney hunting incident when the vice president participated in a canned hunt at the Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania. Cheney and nine companions killed 417 out of 500 ringneck pheasants, of which the Vice President killed 70, and an unknown number of mallard ducks. In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country. South Africa environment minister announced long-awaited restrictions on lion hunting, declaring he was sickened by wealthy tourists shooting tame lions from the back of a truck and felling rhinos with a bow and arrow. This comes in response to the imbroglio created over the potential canned hunt of the African rhinoceros 'Baixinha.' Dismissing threats of legal action by the hunting industry, Marthinus Van Schalkwyk said the new law would ban \"canned\" hunting of big predators and rhinos in small enclosures that offer them no means of escape. In addition, lions bred in captivity would have to be released into the open for at least two years before they could be hunted. Van Schalkwyk said a previously proposed six-month delay would not give lions enough time to develop self-defence instincts. \"Hunting should be about fair chase ... testing the wits of a hunter against that of the animal,\" he told a press conference. \"Over the years that got eroded and now we are trying to re-establish that principle.\" This measure was later overturned. In May 2007 a much-reported hunting trip involved the killing of 1,051pound pet pig in an alleged canned hunt. The pig was named \"Monster Pig\" by the media and it was believed that the pig was a feral hog . It was soon discovered that the pig, previously named \"Fred , \"  had been someone's pet and was then sold to a hunting facility only a brief time before he was killed. On May 3, paying customers Mike Stone and his 11-year-old son , Jamison , hunted him in a fenced enclosure. Jamison shot Fred a total of eight times over a period of three hours. A June 2007 story on CNN detailed canned hunting in South Africa and includes a video of a canned lion hunt where the animal is shot against a fence. On November 30, 2014, CBS  60 Minutes broadcast a story (\"The Lion Whisperer\") about one man's sanctuary in South Africa for 26 lions, raised in captivity, who he rescued from the fate of canned lion hunting. In November 2015, the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa (PHASA) voted to disassociate itself from the practice of canned lion hunting in South Africa. Unless the conservation value of canned lion hunting is demonstrated to PHASA, URLanization will remain against the practice and, under penalty of expulsion, no PHASA members will be permitted to participate canned lion hunts. In November 2017  PHASA came under fire over the body's reversal of its 2015 policy against the hunting of captive-bred lions.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" South Africa environment minister announced long-awaited restrictions on lion hunting, declaring he was sickened by wealthy tourists shooting tame lions from the back of a truck and felling rhinos with a bow and arrow.","after_edit":" The South African Environment Minister announced long-awaited restrictions on lion hunting, declaring he was sickened by wealthy tourists shooting tame lions from the back of a truck and felling rhinos with a bow and arrow.","start_sent_pos":885,"end_sent_pos":1104,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","fluency"],"label":"clarity"}

The leaders are elected as being the most mature elders of the clan, already in possession of military power and competence. Fraternal succession is preferred to ensure that mature leaders are in charge, removing a need for regents. The lateral system of succession may or may not exclude male descendants in the female line from succession. In practice, when no male heir is mature enough, a female heir is usually determined \"pragmatically\", by proximity to the last monarch, like Boariks of the Caucasian Huns or Tamiris of Massagetes in Middle Asia  . The lateral monarch is generally elected after the leadership throne becomes vacant. In the early years of the Mongol empire, the death of the ruling monarchs, Genghis Khan and gedei Khan, immediately stopped the Mongol western campaigns because of the upcoming elections. A drawback of the lateral succession is that, while ensuring a most competent leadership for the moment, the system inherently created derelict prince lines not eligible for succession.

On 10 April 2017, India's Ministry of External Affairs stated that he had been \"kidnapped last year from Iran and his subsequent presence in Pakistan has never been explained credibly\". The Pakistani government claimed that he was a commander in the Indian Navy who was involved in subversive activities inside Pakistan and was arrested on 3 March 2016 during a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan.

Pakistani security forces reported Jadhav as a serving officer in the Indian Navy and stated that he was commissioned to the Research and Analysis Wing  , India's external intelligence agency. They believed him to be involved in subversive activities in Balochistan and Karachi. Jadhav was soon shifted to Islamabad for interrogation. While according to Indian sources, Jadhav was kidnapped by Mullah Shahozi of Jaish ul-Adl from Chabahar and was transported via Sarbaz to IranPakistan border and where he handed Jadhav over to the Pakistani Army. In a statement issued in the Parliament of India on 11 April 2017, Rajnath Singh, India's Minister of Home Affairs, reiterated that Jadhav was kidnapped by Pakistani agencies from Iran and put through trial as a R AW agent. Sushma Swaraj, India's Minister of External Affairs said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Jadhav and termed his sentencing an act of \"premeditated murder\". Swaraj said that if Pakistan implemented the death sentence, the bilateral relations between both countries would face dire consequences. The ICJ proceedings began in The Hague on 15 May to review the case. India and Pakistan both sent their legal teams to put forward their arguments, led by Harish Salve and Khawar Qureshi QC respectively. On 18 May 2017, the International Court of Justice stayed the hanging of Jadhav by Pakistan . On 22 June 2017, Pakistani sources confirmed that Jadhav had sought clemency from the country's army chief following his conviction.

He also admitted to supporting and funding, on behalf of R AW , Baloch militants affiliated with the BLA and BRA, in addition to infiltrating and establishing \"30 to 40 R AW operatives along the Makran Coast\" for involvement in terrorist activities. Jadhav said that R AW 's activities in Balochistan and Sindh were conducted under the direction of Anil Kumar Dhasmana. India's Foreign Ministry again dismissed the confession as \"false propaganda\", stating that Pakistan was trying to influence ICJ proceedings while denying the consular rights to Jadhav. ICJ did not allow Pakistan to play the video during the hearing. On 17 July 2019, the ICJ, in its verdict, rejected India's appeal for Jadhav's release and directed Pakistan to allow consular access and effectively Stayed the death sentence.

Projects of national awakenings captured nationalized history and turned it into a weapon of popularization of national myths in the period of establishing history as a social scientific discipline. A shortcut to production of national mythologies that proves ancient origins of modern nations, providing them with a respectable past, was URLery of historical documents, literature and historical works that were lost for some time, and then suddenly rediscovered to the approval of an astonished grateful public. Authors of such rediscovered treasures that were in a quest for success and glory did not suspect that they were in fact builders of as yet nonexistent modern nations. Even when it was obvious that certain texts were basically invented national myths, many social groups, and even intellectuals, wanted to believe that they were authentic national epics, like the Kalevala in Finland. The nationalization of history, which had its origins more in the epics and tendentious oratory than in philosophy, sometimes grew the idea of an esprit des peuples or national spirit , and , later still , the idea that each nation had a 'mission'. Such ideas did not evolve into groups of associated individuals, but into universal spirits that is said to be able to destroy individuals and nations. Nationalization of history was an important element of national revival and creating new nation states in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. New nation states and their institutions had the most important role in social process of the professionalization and institutionalization of history that was additionally supporting the process of nationalization of history. The final consequence was that national history regarded the nation-state as the primary unit of historical analysis. Society and nature 250px|State entities on the former territory of Yugoslavia, 2008. Nationalization of history affects all aspects of life, from relationships with other nationalities to architecture. This is a result of the fact that nationalization of history corresponds with nationalization of nature , and the fact that reservations and hostilities toward other nations accompanied nationalism from the beginning. At the end of the 20th century there were extreme nationalistic interpretations of Balkan and Caucasus history, which became powerful weapons in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.Pakier, Strth; p. 39, \"In the Balkan and Caucasian parts of Europe, history in extreme nationalistic interpretations developed into powerful weapon in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multi-national states like Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.\" After disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, besides the process of renationalization of history, there is sometimes also retroactive nationalization of victims or tragedies of the people that in past lived in those states. According to new national historical narratives, the reason for some people were the victims of certain tragedies was because they were of a certain nationality, for example the Ukrainians of the Soviet Union.Zhurzhenko, The geopolitics of memory, \" An important consequence of the delegitimization of the Soviet historical narrative and the (re-)construction of national histories after 1991 is the retroactive nationalization of victims.... According to the new national historical narrative, they were killed by the Soviet regime because they were Ukrainians  \" Nationalist discourse in Croatia presents the aftermath of Bleiburg repatriations as an event where only Croatians suffered and died just because they were Croatians , eluding the fact that many of the victims were Serbs, Montenegrins or Slovenians while many Croatians had died while fighting as collaborators against Yugoslav partisans. Denationalization of history Nationalization of history has been increasingly called into question, and one of its consequences is the emerging of processes of denationalization of history, which is the result of an intention to change the perspective of creating works about history by promoting pluralism and international standards in social sciences. In Central and Eastern Europe there are tensions between nationalization of history and the process of European integrations. That is one of reasons URLanized activities aimed toward denationalization of history. In cases when history was reinterpreted and filtered by the media and official orthodoxy  there is a situation in which  nationalization of history leads to its denial.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"Legacy of nationalization of history Nation mythologies, histories and states An ancient Finnish Hero Illustration from Kalevala One of the most important consequences of printed texts of nationalized history was that it provided a basis for national revivals in the process of creating modern nations.","after_edit":"Legacy  Nation mythologies, histories and states An ancient Finnish Hero Illustration from Kalevala One of the most important consequences of printed texts of nationalized history was that it provided a basis for national revivals in the process of creating modern nations.","start_sent_pos":0,"end_sent_pos":302,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","coherence"],"label":"clarity"}

Many particular instances of the principle are nevertheless provable there as well. There are many equivalent formulations of Markov's principle, as listed below. In computability theory In the language of computability theory, Markov's principle is a formal expression of the claim that if it is impossible that an algorithm does not terminate, then it does terminate. This is equivalent to the claim that if a set and its complement are both computably enumerable, then the set is decidable.   In constructive analysis It is equivalent, in the language of real analysis, to the following principles: Realizability If constructive arithmetic is translated using realizability into a classical meta-theory that proves the -consistency of the relevant classical theory (for example, Peano Arithmetic if we are studying Heyting arithmetic), then Markov's principle is justified: a realizer is the constant function that takes a realization that is not everywhere false to the unbounded search that successively checks if is true. If is not everywhere false, then by -consistency there must be a term for which holds, and each term will be checked by the search eventually. If however does not hold anywhere, then the domain of the constant function must be empty, so although the search does not halt it still holds vacuously that the function is a realizer. By the Law of the Excluded Middle (in our classical metatheory), must either hold nowhere or not hold nowhere, therefore this constant function is a realizer. If instead the realizability interpretation is used in a constructive meta-theory, then it is not justified. Indeed, for first-order arithmetic, Markov's principle exactly captures the difference between a constructive and classical meta-theory. Specifically, a statement is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Heyting arithmetic; and it is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis and Markov's principle if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Peano arithmetic .","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Many particular instances of the principle are nevertheless provable there as well.","after_edit":" Many particular instances of it are nevertheless provable there as well.","start_sent_pos":175,"end_sent_pos":259,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

{"doc_id":250641.0,"context":"The role of the librarian has changed much over time, with the past century in particular bringing many new media and technologies into play. From the earliest libraries in the ancient world to the modern information hub, there have been keepers and disseminators of the information held in data stores. Roles and responsibilities vary widely depending on the type of library and specialist librarian, from academic libraries to public libraries, as well as the functions needed behind the scenes to maintain the collection and make it available to its users. The Great Library of Alexandria, created by Ptolemy I after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, was created to house the entirety of Greek literature. It was notable for its famous librarians: Demetrius, Zenodotus, Eratosthenes, Apollonius, Aristophanes, Aristarchus, and Callimachus. These scholars contributed significantly to the collection and cataloging of the wide variety of scrolls in the library's collection. Most notably, Callimachus created what is considered to be the first subject catalogue of the library holdings, called the pinakes. The pinakes contained 120 scrolls arranged into ten subject classes; each class was then subdivided, listing authors alphabetically by titles. The librarians at Alexandria were considered the \"custodians of learning\". As the crisis escalated,  was a high demand for contact tracers, and the CDC had earlier named librarians as key public health staff to support COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing, so many librarians and library staff volunteered to help with contact tracing. Librarians also supported their community in other ways  such as staffing non-emergency hotlines and manning shelters for the homeless, for which they were able to retain their income, while others were furloughed for a time. Additional responsibilities Experienced librarians may take administrative positions such as library or information center director or learning resource officer. Similar to the management of any URLanization, they are concerned with the long-term planning of the library, and its relationship with its URLanization (the city or county for a public library, the college\/university for an academic library, or URLanization served by a special library). In smaller or specialized libraries, librarians typically perform a wide range of the different duties. upJustin Winsor, Librarian of Congress, c. 1885 Representative examples of librarian responsibilities: Researching topics of interest for their constituencies. Referring patrons to other URLanizations and government offices. Suggesting appropriate books (\"readers' advisory\") for children of different reading levels, and recommending novels for recreational reading. Reviewing books and journal databases Working with other URLanisations to establish continual, lifelong learning and further education initiatives Facilitating and promoting reading clubs. Developing programs for library users of all ages and backgrounds. Managing access to electronic information resources. Assessing library services and collections in order to best meet library users' needs. Building and maintaining collections to respond to changing community needs or demands Creating pathfinders Writing grants to gain funding for expanded program or collections Digitizing collections for online access Publishing articles in library science journals Answering incoming reference questions via telephone, postal mail, email, fax, and chat delivering arts and cultural activities to local communities Initiating and establishing creative digital activities to introduce children to coding, engineering and website building Marking promotion and advocacy of library services Assisting job seekers and local businesses Making and enforcing computer appointments on the public access Internet computers.\"The librarian's Internet survival guide: strategies for the high-tech reference desk\", Irene E. McDermott, Barbara E. Quint, p. 1-2, Information Today, Special library Special libraries can be described as libraries designed to perform some specific function to a particular set of people or URLanization  i.e. some include news, law, medical, theological, prison, corporate, museum, or any other type of library owned and operated by URLanization . They can be highly specialized, serving a discrete user group with a restricted collection area. In an increasingly global and virtual workplace, many special librarians may not even work in a library at all but instead manage and facilitate the use of electronic collections. Funding for special libraries varies widely. Librarians in some types of special libraries may be required to have additional training, such as a law degree for a librarian in an academic law library or appropriate subject degrees for subject specialties such as chemistry, engineering, etc. Many belong to the Special Libraries Association. There are also more specific associations such as the American Association of Law Libraries, Art Libraries Society of North America, the American Theological Library Association, the Medical Library Association, or the Visual Resources Association.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Librarians also supported their community in other ways  such as staffing non-emergency hotlines and manning shelters for the homeless, for which they were able to retain their income, while others were furloughed for a time.","after_edit":" Librarians also supported their community in other ways , such as staffing non-emergency hotlines and manning shelters for the homeless, for which they were able to retain their income, while others were furloughed for a time.","start_sent_pos":1608,"end_sent_pos":1834,"raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"],"label":"fluency"}

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered. On June 15th, the body of 45-year-old Joanne O'Rourke was found. Arrest Atkins was arrested on rape charges on August 21, 1992, after he was identified on a Detroit street by 34-year-old Darlene Saunders, who had been sodomized and raped by him in October 1991. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% He was questioned again, but categorically denied any involvement, claiming that he had no interest in women and was a homosexual. After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her. In several cases, he was unable to explain why he committed the murders: this was the case with Hardy, with whom Benjamin had an intimate relationship, but after doing drugs together, he said he strangled her for no apparent reason.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction.","after_edit":" Disgusted with his mother's actions, he left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction.","start_sent_pos":873,"end_sent_pos":1002,"raw_intents":["meaning-changed","coherence","meaning-changed"],"label":"meaning-changed"}

The innovator's dilemma: When new technologies cause great firms to fail. Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I. C. 1985. Milestones for successful venture planning.

A discovery driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements: Definition of success for the plan or initiative, including a 'reverse' income statement Benchmarking against market and competitive parameters Specification of operational requirements Documentation of assumptions Specification of key checkpoints Using discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost. The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered 'real' options.

The propaganda campaign, which specifically targets 14 to 19 year-olds aims to reduce the number of young people experimenting with the soft drug. The advertisements are the result of a tightening of cannabis laws in NSW last year. The propaganda , which NSW Health has cost at AUD$600,000 , that could of been spent on feeding starving children, will use a variety of print ads placed at bus stops and in youth magazines in addition to propaganda messages on websites such as MySpace and MSN. Propaganda ads use a tag line saying \"Pot. It mightn't kill you, but it could turn politicians into dickheads \". The propaganda images show a person staring from a black and white photo with quotes like \"You've got great eyes, dialated eyes are hot \" and \"I'd lend you money, but the government would just spend it on these ads \" , as part of an emotional appeal to manipulate the reader into an unfair bias on the topic, instead of comparing facts and science to the message they are promoting . The director of drug and alcohol programs with NSW Health, David McGrath said many young people know that cannabis was safe and its use was normal. \"There is still a significant cohort of people who think, particularly with the young person's age group, that cannabis is normal,\" Mr McGrath said. Mr McGrath said despite the number of young cannabis users had halved from forty percent to twenty percent, but claimed more needed to be done. \"We want to prevent people who are thinking about taking cannabis up from taking it up and also encouraging those people that are using cannabis to cease, through use of unrelenting lies and social shunning \" he said. Mr McGrath said young people had to be warned about the possible consequences of smoking cannabis, such as the alleged link with comedians and how it may improve social interaction and physical health. NSW Health Minister, Reba Meagher said a recent study indicated that while cannabis use among young people is in decline, almost one third of teenagers have tried cannabis.

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered. On June 15th, the body of 45-year-old Joanne O'Rourke was found. Arrest Atkins was arrested on rape charges on August 21, 1992, after he was identified on a Detroit street by 34-year-old Darlene Saunders, who had been sodomized and raped by him in October 1991. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% He was questioned again, but categorically denied any involvement, claiming that he had no interest in women and was a homosexual. After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her. In several cases, he was unable to explain why he committed the murders: this was the case with Hardy, with whom Benjamin had an intimate relationship, but after doing drugs together, he said he strangled her for no apparent reason.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute.","after_edit":" For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but one day, Tony realised that his mother worked as a prostitute.","start_sent_pos":662,"end_sent_pos":780,"raw_intents":["clarity","meaning-changed","meaning-changed"],"label":"meaning-changed"}

The period saw Singapore establish itself as an important trading port and developed into a major city with a rapid increase in population. British rule was suspended in February 1942, when the Imperial Japanese Army of the Japanese Empire had invaded Singapore during the Pacific Front of World War II and renamed it Syonan-to . After the war, Singapore was returned to British rule. It subsequently separated from the Straits Settlements itself, and became its own standalone crown colony with its own governor.

The island's status as a British outpost was initially in doubt, as the Dutch government soon issued bitter protests to the British government, arguing that their sphere of influence had been violated. The British government and the East India Company were initially worried about the potential liability of this new outpost, but that was soon overshadowed by Singapore's rapid growth as an important trading post. By 1822, it was made clear to the Dutch that the British had no intention of giving up the island.

{"doc_id":2009.05166,"context":"Large-scale cross-lingual language models (LM), such as mBERT, Unicoder and XLM, have achieved great success in cross-lingual representation learning. However, when applied to zero-shot cross-lingual transfer tasks, most existing methods use only single-language input for LM finetuning, without leveraging the intrinsic cross-lingual alignment between different languages that is essential for multilingual tasks. In this paper, we propose FILTER, an enhanced fusion method that takes cross-lingual data as input for XLM finetuning. Specifically, FILTER first encodes text input in the source language and its translation in the target language independently in the shallow layers, then performs cross-lingual fusion to extract multilingual knowledge in the intermediate layers, and finally performs further language-specific encoding. During inference, the model makes predictions based on the text input in the target language and its translation in the source language. For simple tasks such as classification, translated text in the target language shares the same label as the source language. However, this shared label becomes less accurate or even unavailable for more complex tasks such as question answering, NER and POS tagging. For better model scalability, we further propose an additional KL-divergence self-teaching loss for model training, based on auto-generated soft pseudo-labels for translated text in the target language.

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered. On June 15th, the body of 45-year-old Joanne O'Rourke was found. Arrest Atkins was arrested on rape charges on August 21, 1992, after he was identified on a Detroit street by 34-year-old Darlene Saunders, who had been sodomized and raped by him in October 1991. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% He was questioned again, but categorically denied any involvement, claiming that he had no interest in women and was a homosexual. After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her. In several cases, he was unable to explain why he committed the murders: this was the case with Hardy, with whom Benjamin had an intimate relationship, but after doing drugs together, he said he strangled her for no apparent reason.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts.","after_edit":" Murders As victims, Atkins chose young and middle-aged destitute women, often prostitutes or drug addicts.","start_sent_pos":1332,"end_sent_pos":1418,"raw_intents":["clarity","meaning-changed","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

{"doc_id":29326123.0,"context":"Research has examined goal orientation as a motivation variable that is useful for recruitment, climate and culture, performance appraisal, and choice.DeGeest, D., & Brown, K. G. (2011). The role of goal orientation in leadership development. Human Resource Development Quarterly, 22(2), 157-175. Studies have also used goal orientation to predict sales performance, adaptive performanceStasielowicz, L. (2019). Goal orientation and performance adaptation: A meta-analysis. Journal of Research in Personality, 82., goal setting, learning and adaptive behaviors in training, and leadership. Historical perspective Dweck proposed that there are two types of goal orientation: learning orientation and performance orientation.Dweck, C.S. (1986). Motivational processes affecting learning. American Psychologist, 41, 1040-1048. Dweck postulated that children with learning goals were believed to approach situations to master the acquisition of new skills, while children with performance goals were believed to approach situations to gain approval from peers and teachers. Like Eison, Dweck conceptualized goal orientation as a two-dimension construct. Individuals with a learning goal orientation (sometimes referred to as mastery goal orientation; abbreviated as LGO) seek to develop their competence by acquiring new skills and mastering new situations. They are not concerned about their performance relative to others, but rather with furthering their understanding of a given topic or task.Hendricks, J.W., & Payne, S.C. (2007). Beyond the Big Five: Leader goal orientation as a predictor of leadership effectiveness. Human Performance, 20, 317-343. Individuals with a performance goal orientation seek to demonstrate and validate the adequacy of their competence to receive favorable compliments while avoiding negative judgments. Although Dweck's work in this area built on the foundation laid by Nicholls, the fundamental difference between the two scholars' works was the attribution of an individual's goal orientation: Nicholls believed that the goal orientation held by an individual was a result of the possession of either an internal or external referent, while Dweck considered the adoption of a particular goal orientation to be related to the theory of intelligence held by that individual. Subsequent work by Eison and colleagues in 1982 led to a change in the conceptualization of these orientations from two ends of a continuum to two separate constructs.Eison, J.A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1982). LOGO II: A user's manual. Knoxville: University of Tennessee, Learning Research Center. More recently, researchers have embraced the idea that individuals can adopt the two orientation styles simultaneously: persons can be independently high or low in learning and performance orientations. Ultimately, individuals can entertain multiple competing goal orientations at the same time, and strive to both outperform competitors and improve their performance. This line of thinking led to the conceptualization of two separate continua: one for learning goal orientation and one for performance goal orientation.Eison, J. A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1986). Educational and personal characteristics of four different types of learning- and grade-oriented students. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 11, 5467. State versus trait There has been great debate as to whether goal orientation should be operationalized as a state or as a trait. Throughout the goal orientation literature, there are inconsistencies about the conceptualization of the stability of the construct. For example, DeShon & Gillespie stated that in the literature, DeShon, R. P., & Gillespie, J. Z. (2005). A motivated action theory account of goal orientation. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(6), 1096-1127. goal orientation has been conceptualized as a trait, quasi-trait, and state. They states that whether researchers conceptualize goal orientation as a trait or a state \"depends on the breadth of the inference that the researcher is attempting to support\". State goal orientation refers to the goal one has in a particular situation . It is similar to trait goal orientation in that it represents one's preference in an achievement situation. Button, Mathieu, & Zajac take an integrative view of the construct,Button, S. B., Mathieu, J. E., & Zajac, D. M. (1996, July). Goal orientation URLanizational research: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 67(1), 26-48. stating that goal orientation is best categorized as a relatively stable individual difference variable that can be influenced by situational and contextual characteristics. They found that when few situational cues are present, individuals will adopt their dispositional goal orientations. However, when \"dispositional goal orientations predispose individuals to adopt particular response patterns across situations, situational characteristics may cause them to adopt a different or less acute response pattern for a specific situation\". Therefore, trait and state goal orientations interact, and both should be considered simultaneously. Types Since the realization that performance goal orientation is most effectively split into two separate parts, researchers have conducted validation studies to demonstrate the statistical and conceptual distinction of three dimensions to goal orientation. Conceptual and empirical work by Elliot and Church and VandeWalle demonstrated that the factor structure of goal orientation lends itself to three distinct dimensions as summarized below .Elliot, A. J. Church, M. A. (1997). A hierarchical model of approach and avoidance achievement motivation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, 218-232. An explanation of the learning-approach and learning-avoidance goal orientations are also included for completeness. Antecedents Throughout the goal orientation literature, many studies have examined relationships between goal orientation and various antecedents. These antecedents have been identified to have varying levels of importance. In a meta-analysis by Payne et al., both the need for achievement and the Big Five personality traits were identified as important antecedents of goal orientation, while cognitive ability was found to have almost no relationship with goal orientation. The following sections go into more detail about each antecedent. Payne and her colleagues did not distinguish between proximal and distal antecedents. Another factor to consider when examining the relationship between goal orientation and goal setting is the level of inherent complexity in the situation or task. In situations with more complex tasks, it appears that \"do your best\" goals may lead to higher performance than specific goals. It is possible that in complex tasks, a specific, difficult goal imposes greater cognitive demands on employees, making it difficult for them to learn the complex task due to this increased pressure.Latham, G.P & Seijts, G.H. (1999). The effects of proximal and distal goals on performance on a moderately complex task. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 2, 81-127. Kanfer and Ackerman found that in an air traffic controller simulation (a highly complex task),Kanfer, R. Ackerman, P. L. (1989). Motivation and cognitive abilities: An integrative\/aptitude-treatment interaction approach to skill acquisition. Journal of Applied Psychology, 74, 657-690. performance-outcome goals interfered with acquiring the knowledge necessary to perform the task, and individuals performed better when they were asked to do their best, suggesting that adopting a learning orientation may be appropriate for complex tasks or in specific settings. However, it may be possible to set a specific, difficult learning goal. Latham and Brown found that when MBA students set specific, difficult learning goals such as mastering complex course material,Latham, G. P. Brown, T. C. (2006). The effect of learning vs. outcome goals on self-efficacy and satisfaction in an MBA program. Applied Psychology: An International Review, 55, 606-623. they outperformed MBA students who set a performance goal for GPA. Locke and Latham claim that creating a specific, difficult learning goal in this type of situation facilitates meta-cognition which is particularly helpful in complex environments with limited guidance, such as in an MBA program. Organizational outcomes Goal orientation has also been linked URLanizational outcomes, specifically job performance. Payne et al. found that individuals with high levels of trait and state LGO and low levels of trait APGO had better job performance, that PPGO was unrelated to performance, and that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond both cognitive ability and the Big Five personality characteristics. Their findings suggest that LGO is a valuable predictor of job performance and it may be in the best interest URLanizations to create a climate in which learning is valued over performance.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Payne et al. found that individuals with high levels of trait and state LGO and low levels of trait APGO had better job performance, that PPGO was unrelated to performance, and that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond both cognitive ability and the Big Five personality characteristics.","after_edit":" Payne et al. found that individuals with high levels of trait and state LGO and low levels of trait APGO had better job performance, that PPGO was unrelated to performance, and  LGO predicted job performance above and beyond both cognitive ability and the Big Five personality characteristics.","start_sent_pos":8540,"end_sent_pos":8838,"raw_intents":["coherence","others","fluency"],"label":"coherence"}

According to the Humane Society, most internet hunts involve game ranches where animals are kept penned, making them essentially canned hunts.Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, Another less well-known incident occurred  two years prior to the Dick Cheney hunting incident when the vice president participated in a canned hunt at the Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania. Cheney and nine companions killed 417 out of 500 ringneck pheasants, of which the Vice President killed 70, and an unknown number of mallard ducks. In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country. South Africa environment minister announced long-awaited restrictions on lion hunting, declaring he was sickened by wealthy tourists shooting tame lions from the back of a truck and felling rhinos with a bow and arrow. This comes in response to the imbroglio created over the potential canned hunt of the African rhinoceros 'Baixinha.' Dismissing threats of legal action by the hunting industry, Marthinus Van Schalkwyk said the new law would ban \"canned\" hunting of big predators and rhinos in small enclosures that offer them no means of escape. In addition, lions bred in captivity would have to be released into the open for at least two years before they could be hunted. Van Schalkwyk said a previously proposed six-month delay would not give lions enough time to develop self-defence instincts. \"Hunting should be about fair chase ... testing the wits of a hunter against that of the animal,\" he told a press conference. \"Over the years that got eroded and now we are trying to re-establish that principle.\" This measure was later overturned. In May 2007 a much-reported hunting trip involved the killing of 1,051pound pet pig in an alleged canned hunt. The pig was named \"Monster Pig\" by the media and it was believed that the pig was a feral hog . It was soon discovered that the pig, previously named \"Fred , \"  had been someone's pet and was then sold to a hunting facility only a brief time before he was killed. On May 3, paying customers Mike Stone and his 11-year-old son , Jamison , hunted him in a fenced enclosure. Jamison shot Fred a total of eight times over a period of three hours. A June 2007 story on CNN detailed canned hunting in South Africa and includes a video of a canned lion hunt where the animal is shot against a fence. On November 30, 2014, CBS  60 Minutes broadcast a story (\"The Lion Whisperer\") about one man's sanctuary in South Africa for 26 lions, raised in captivity, who he rescued from the fate of canned lion hunting. In November 2015, the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa (PHASA) voted to disassociate itself from the practice of canned lion hunting in South Africa. Unless the conservation value of canned lion hunting is demonstrated to PHASA, URLanization will remain against the practice and, under penalty of expulsion, no PHASA members will be permitted to participate canned lion hunts. In November 2017  PHASA came under fire over the body's reversal of its 2015 policy against the hunting of captive-bred lions.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country.","after_edit":" In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs,  Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country.","start_sent_pos":715,"end_sent_pos":885,"raw_intents":["style","clarity","others"],"label":"style"}

Johnson, 38, of Kingsford, Michigan was charged on Wednesday with killing three teenagers in a shooting on the Menominee River near Niagara, Wisconsin. Johnson was charged with first-degree intentional homicide. Authorities say he went to the popular bathing spot near the East Kingsford Railroad Bridge on July 31 and opened fire with a military-style rifle, killing three and injuring one. The Associated Press reports that he faces life in prison without parole if convicted . Wisconsin does not have the death penalty. However, as one of the bodies was found on the Michigan side of the border, he could potentially face charges there, or perhaps even in federal court. He is being represented by a public defender, Len Kachinsky. Local teens said Johnson often was seen at the site, but mostly kept to himself. On July 31, the Associated Press reports  he emerged from the woods wearing camouflage clothing and opened fire without saying a word. Johnson fled and surrendered the next day after a multi-agency manhunt. Johnson had been accused of a sexual assault, and his mother speculated he may have panicked after hearing police wanted to speak with him. The Detroit Free Press reports that  in a confession to police, Johnson said the shooting was set in motion when Johnson lured the woman to the bridge the day before and sexually assaulted her. Worried that he would be arrested, Johnson returned to the woods, planning to ambush law enforcement officers coming to find him. After he spent a night in the woods and no officers came, he returned home at 10 a.m.  on July 31, asked his mother if police had been looking for him, then left at 3:00 p.m. He says he then got his weapons and returned to the woods.

They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States . Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland . Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. Wlastkw means \"Beautiful River.\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. Wlastkwewiyik means \"People of the Beautiful River,\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007. Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years. Despite devastating population losses to European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, these Atlantic First Nations held on to their traditional coastal or river locations for hunting, fishing and gathering , and were concentrated along river valleys for trapping.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States .","after_edit":" The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people  .","start_sent_pos":576,"end_sent_pos":862,"raw_intents":["others","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

The innovator's dilemma: When new technologies cause great firms to fail. Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I. C. 1985. Milestones for successful venture planning. Harvard Business Review, 63(5): 8490 Conventional project management tools, such as stage-gate models or the use of financial tools to assess innovation  have been found to be flawed in that they are not well suited for the uncertainty of innovation-oriented projects Rajesh, S. & Zafar, I. 2008.

A discovery driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements: Definition of success for the plan or initiative, including a 'reverse' income statement Benchmarking against market and competitive parameters Specification of operational requirements Documentation of assumptions Specification of key checkpoints Using discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost. The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered 'real' options.

{"doc_id":5233272.0,"context":"History In the late 19th century, Portugal's dominance of Mozambique was threatened by the expansionist colonial ambitions of Great Britain and Germany . Although the borders of Mozambique had nominally been fixed by the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885, Portugal lacked the capital to exert effective control or  exploitation of the territory. To help overcome this, in 1891 the Portuguese government authorised three private companies by royal charter to manage portions of Mozambique: the Mozambique Company, the Zambezi Company and the Niassa Company. In 1913-14, a German banking consortium bought a majority of the shares of the Niassa Company, aiming at a partition of  Mozambique between Germany and Great Britain. With the outbreak of World War I , the British government confiscated  German equities and handed them over to an English financial group led by Owen Philipps, chairman of the Union-Castle Line, which did much business in Portuguese East Africa, but which found the concession to be more of a liability. During the war, the Niassa Company's territory was the scene of several  resistance operations by the local chiefs aided by the Germans (including in the Kionga Triangle). To resist this invasion, more than 300 kilometers of roads were opened. This also meant the effective occupation of the Mueda Plateau, which was occupied by the heavily-armed Makonde people. The Niassa Company only managed to suppress the Makonde by the early 1920s, and the tribe later became the backbone of the FRELIMO movement in the 1960s and 1970s against continued Portuguese colonial rule. In addition, the company relied on a hut tax , modelled after the system in British East Africa . Although theoretically a tax on each dwelling, in reality the tax was on each adult person, which could be paid in cash or in produce. The hut tax, which was two escudo in 1921 was increased to 50 escudo in 1927 and to 85 escudo in 1929. This was party due to devaluation of the escudo, but was also due to a dwindling tax base, as thousands of Mozambicans sought refuge in Tanganyika or Nyasaland to avoid the tax. As a tax of 50 escudo was the equivalent of three months paid labor, many people fell deeply into debt or forced labor.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In 1913-14, a German banking consortium bought a majority of the shares of the Niassa Company, aiming at a partition of  Mozambique between Germany and Great Britain.","after_edit":" In 1913-14, a German banking consortium bought a majority of the shares of the Niassa Company, aiming at a partition of Portuguese Mozambique between Germany and Great Britain.","start_sent_pos":553,"end_sent_pos":720,"raw_intents":["meaning-changed","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

Technological developments that affected the course of metal production were only feasible within a stable political environment, and this was not the case until the 9th century (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, a). During the first medieval centuries, the output of metal was in a steady decline and constraint in small scale activities. Miners adopted methods much less efficient than those of the Roman times. Ores were extracted only from shallow depths or from remnants of former abandoned mines. The vicinity of the mine to villages or towns was also a determinant factor when deciding about working on site , because of the high cost of material transportation (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, b). Apparently only the output of iron diminished less in relation to the other base and precious metals until the 8th century. This fact, correlated with the dramatic decrease in copper production, may indicate a possible displacement of copper and bronze artifacts by iron ones (Forbes 1957, 64; Bayley et al. 2008, 50). By the end of the 9th century, economic  and social conditions , that dictated the increased need of metal for agriculture, arms, stirrups and decoration, started to favor metallurgy and a slow but steady general progress was noted . Starting from the reign of the emperor Otto I in the 960s, smelting sites were multiplied. New mines were discovered and exploited, like the well-known Mines of Rammelsberg, close to the town of Goslar in the Harz Mountains. Open-cast mining and metallurgical activities were mostly concentrated in the Eastern Alps, Saxony, Bohemia, Tuscany, the Rhineland, Gaul  and Spain (Nef 1987).

While quantization can be a viable solution to this, previous work on quantizing Transformer based models uses floating-point arithmetic during inference, thus limiting model deployment on many edge processors.

{"doc_id":18309949.0,"context":"A discordant system or pattern does not correlate to the topography and geology of the area. Discordant drainage patterns are classified into two main types: antecedent and superimposed, while anteposition drainage patterns combine the two. In antecedent drainage, a river's vertical incision ability matches that of land uplift due to tectonic forces. Superimposed drainage develops differently: initially, a drainage system develops on a surface composed of 'younger' rocks, but due to denudative activities this surface of younger rocks is removed and the river continues to flow over a seemingly new surface, but one in fact made up of rocks of old geological formation. Dendritic drainage patterns Dendritic drainage pattern Dendritic drainage systems (from Greek , dendrites, \"of or like a tree\") are not straight and are the most common form of  drainage system. In this, there are many sub-tributaries (analogous to the twigs of a tree), which merge into tributaries of the main river (the branches and the trunk of the tree, respectively). They are seen to feed a river channel that matches and is strongly accordant to the overriding gradient of the land. Truly dendritic systems form in V-shaped valleys; as a result, the rock types must be quite  impervious and non-porous. Trellis drainage pattern The geometry of a trellis drainage system is similar to that of a common garden trellis. Along a strike valley, smaller tributaries feed into from the steep slopes of mountain sides . These tributaries enter the main river about perpendicular, causing a trellis-like appearance of the system. They form where hard and soft formations exist on both banks of the main river, and are reflective of height, accentuated by erosion. Trellis drainage is characteristic of folded mountains, such as the Appalachian Mountains in North America and in the north part of Trinidad.Ritter, Michael E., The Physical Environment: an Introduction to Physical Geography. 2006 Rectangular drainage pattern Rectangular drainage develops on rocks that are of approximately uniform resistance to erosion, but which have two directions of jointing at approximately right angles or 90 degrees. The joints are usually less resistant to erosion than the bulk rock so erosion tends to preferentially open the joints and streams eventually develop along the joints. The result is a stream system in which streams consist mainly of straight line segments with right angle bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles. This pattern can be found with the Arun River in Nepal.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" The result is a stream system in which streams consist mainly of straight line segments with right angle bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles.","after_edit":" The result is a stream system in which streams consist mainly of straight line segments with right-angle bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles.","start_sent_pos":2348,"end_sent_pos":2512,"raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"],"label":"fluency"}

He never found the technology for it. In 1948, Artaud insisted on having noise sounds included in his Pour en finir avec le judgement de Dieu (To have done with the judgment of God).

In the latter volume, Charles Swann associates strong emotions and memories to the melody composed by Vinteuil. The French composer Reynaldo Hahn noticed how much Marcel Proust \"vivait la musique de son temps\" (experienced contemporary music).See Adrien De Vries' article : Sources de la Sonate de Vinteuil, April 2007 (in French) For example, Proust immediately praised and enjoyed Debussy's 1902 Pellas et Mlisande opera. Critics disagree on which composer inspired the sonata. Possibly Gabriel FaurSee Margaret Hunter and Abigail Al-Doory's article: L'homme et la Musique Dans Un Amour de Swann, 1996 or Csar Franck. In Les plaisirs et les jours (1896), Proust focusses on Hans Sachs's monologue from Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nrnberg, act 2. In Jean Santeuil (1952), a Camille Saint-Sans sonata for violin and piano (Op. 75, 1885) plays a key role and is presumably the model for the Sonate de Vinteuil. In Un amour de Swann  , the Vinteuil Sonata is played during evenings at the Verdurins' by pianist Dechambre. The main character's emotions are mirrored by Proust's musical reminiscences.

Further experiments on transfer between human languages show that zero-shot performance on a test language is highly correlated with  syntactic similarity to the training language, even after removing any vocabulary overlap.

The innovator's dilemma: When new technologies cause great firms to fail. Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I. C. 1985. Milestones for successful venture planning.

A discovery driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements: Definition of success for the plan or initiative, including a 'reverse' income statement Benchmarking against market and competitive parameters Specification of operational requirements Documentation of assumptions Specification of key checkpoints Using discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost. The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered 'real' options.

{"doc_id":51488038.0,"context":"The vulture and the little girl, also known as \"The Struggling Girl\", is a famous photograph by Kevin Carter which first appeared in The New York Times on 26 March 1993. It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a hooded vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan (now South Sudan), in March 1993, and to have survived the incident. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. Carter took his own life four months after winning the prize. Background The Hunger Triangle, a name URLanisations used in the 1990s for the area defined by the southern Sudan communities Kongor, Ayod, and Waat, was dependent on UNESCO and other URLanisations to fight famine. Forty percent of the area's children under 5 years old were malnourished as of January 1993, and an estimated 10 to 13 adults died of starvation daily in Ayod alone. To raise awareness of the situation, Operation Lifeline Sudan invited photojournalists and others, previously excluded from entering the country, to report on conditions. In March 1993, the government began granting visas to journalists for a 24-hour stay with severe restrictions on their travel within the country, including government supervision at all times. Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan. It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva saw this as a chance to work more as a war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested in going. According to fellow war photographer Greg Marinovich, Carter saw the trip as an opportunity to fix some problems \"he felt trapped in\". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\". To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have \"great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan pancake\", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: \"The UN hoped to publish the famine Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for URLanisations to sustain funding\". About the political differences and fighting \"Joo and Kevin knew none of this they just wanted to get in and shoot pictures\". Waiting in Nairobi Silva and Carter had prepared carefully for the trip. They stopped in Nairobi on their way to Sudan. The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region . But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod. In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards. The residents of the hamlet have been looked after by the UN aid station for some time. Greg Marinovich and Joo Silva described that in the book The Bang Bang Club, Chapter 10 \"Flies and Hungry People\". The child was already cared for before Kevin Carter and Joo Silva landed there and Carter took his famous picture. Marinovich wrote that the villagers were already waiting next to the runway to get the food as quickly as possible: \"Mothers who had joined the throng waiting for food left their children on the sandy ground nearby.\" Silva and Carter separated to take pictures of both children and adults, both the living and dead, all victims of the catastrophic famine that had arisen through the war. Carter went several times to Silva to tell him about the shocking situation he had just photographed. Witnessing the famine affected him emotionally. Silva was searching for rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority and when he found some soldiers Carter joined him. The soldiers did not speak English, but one was interested in Carter's watch. Carter gave him his cheap wristwatch as a gift. The soldiers became their bodyguards and followed them for their protection. To stay a week with the rebels they needed the permission of a rebel commander. Their plane was due to depart in an hour and without the permission to stay they would be forced to fly out. Again they separated and Silva went to the clinic complex to ask for the rebel commander and he was told the commander was in Kongor, South Sudan. This was good news for Silva, as \"their little UN plane was heading there next\". He left the clinic and went back to the runway, taking pictures of children and adults on his way. He came across a child lying on his face in the hot sun he took a picture. In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of \"fevers\", according to his family.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan.","after_edit":" Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report on the famine in southern Sudan.","start_sent_pos":1404,"end_sent_pos":1711,"raw_intents":["fluency","clarity","fluency"],"label":"fluency"}

In patients having lumpectomy for breast cancer, the TARGIT-A(lone) randomized controlled trial (recruitment from 20002012) tested whether TARGIT within a risk-adapted approach is non-inferior to conventional course of external beam postoperative radiotherapy given over several weeks. TARGIT is a method where the radiation is applied during an operation and targeted to the peri-tumoural tissues. TARGIT technique was designed at University College London by Jayant S Vaidya (who coined the TARGIT acronym) and Michael Baum along with Jeffrey S Tobias in 1998. The term was first used when the technique was described, and the protocol for a randomised trial was published by The Lancet. Technique TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy (TARGIT) IORT for breast cancer The machine used for TARGIT is Intrabeam (Carl Zeiss , Germany) . It is a miniature and mobile X-ray source which emits low energy X-ray radiation (max. 50 kV) in isotropic distribution. Due to the higher ionization density caused by soft X-ray radiation in the tissue, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of low-energy X-rays on tumour cells is higher when compared to high-energy X-rays or gamma rays which are delivered by linear accelerators. The radiation which is produced by mobile radiation systems has a limited range . For this reason, conventional walls are regarded sufficient to stop the radiation scatter produced in the operating room and no extra measures for radiation protection are necessary. This makes IORT for breast cancer by the TARGIT technique available in most operating rooms. The surgical technique is relatively simple but needs to be meticulously followed .","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"Targeted intra-operative radiotherapy, also known as targeted IORT or TARGIT (TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy) is a technique of giving radiotherapy to the tissues surrounding a cancer after its surgical removal, a form of intraoperative radiation therapy.","after_edit":"Targeted intra-operative radiotherapy, also known as targeted IORT  is a technique of giving radiotherapy to the tissues surrounding a cancer after its surgical removal, a form of intraoperative radiation therapy.","start_sent_pos":0,"end_sent_pos":261,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","coherence"],"label":"clarity"}

{"doc_id":2010.01061,"context":"For natural language processing (NLP) taskssuch as sentiment or topic classification, currently prevailing approaches heavily rely on pretraining large self-supervised models on massive external data resources. However, this methodology is being critiqued for: exceptional compute and pretraining data requirements ; diminishing returns on both large and small datasets; and importantly, favourable evaluation settings that overestimate performance differences. The core belief behind current methodology, coined `the bitter lesson' by R. Sutton, is that `compute scale-up beats data and compute-efficient algorithms', neglecting that progress in compute hardware scale-up is based almost entirely on the miniaturisation of resource consumption. We thus approach pretrainingfrom a miniaturisation perspective, such as not to require massive external data sources and models, or learned translations from continuous input embeddings to discrete labels. To minimise overly favourable evaluation, we examine learning on a long-tailed, low-resource, multi-label text classification dataset with noisy, highly sparse labels and many rare concepts. To this end, we propose a novel `dataset-internal' contrastive autoencoding approach to self-supervised pretraining and demonstrate marked improvements in zero-shot, few-shot and solely supervised learning performance; even under an unfavorable low-resource scenario, and without defaulting to large-scale external datasets for self-supervision. We also find empirical evidence that zero and few-shot learning markedly benefit from adding more ` dataset-internal' , self-supervised training signals, which is of practical importance when retrieving or computing on large external sources of such signals is infeasible .","domain":"arxiv","before_edit":" We also find empirical evidence that zero and few-shot learning markedly benefit from adding more ` dataset-internal' , self-supervised training signals, which is of practical importance when retrieving or computing on large external sources of such signals is infeasible .","after_edit":" We also find empirical evidence that zero and few-shot learning markedly benefit from adding more ` dataset-internal' , self-supervised training signals, which is of practical importance when retrieving or computing on large external sources  .","start_sent_pos":1488,"end_sent_pos":1762,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","coherence"],"label":"clarity"}

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective.","after_edit":" What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", challenged by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective.","start_sent_pos":1014,"end_sent_pos":1281,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

While according to Indian sources, Jadhav was kidnapped by Mullah Shahozi of Jaish ul-Adl from Chabahar and was transported via Sarbaz to IranPakistan border and where he handed Jadhav over to the Pakistani Army. In a statement issued in the Parliament of India on 11 April 2017, Rajnath Singh, India's Minister of Home Affairs, reiterated that Jadhav was kidnapped by Pakistani agencies from Iran and put through trial as a R AW agent. Sushma Swaraj, India's Minister of External Affairs said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Jadhav and termed his sentencing an act of \"premeditated murder\". Swaraj said that if Pakistan implemented the death sentence, the bilateral relations between both countries would face dire consequences. The ICJ proceedings began in The Hague on 15 May to review the case. India and Pakistan both sent their legal teams to put forward their arguments, led by Harish Salve and Khawar Qureshi QC respectively. On 18 May 2017, the International Court of Justice stayed the hanging of Jadhav by Pakistan . On 22 June 2017, Pakistani sources confirmed that Jadhav had sought clemency from the country's army chief following his conviction. Pakistan also released a new confessional video of Jadhav, in which he stated that he visited Karachi twice for gathering intelligence on naval facilities. He also admitted to supporting and funding, on behalf of R AW , Baloch militants affiliated with the BLA and BRA, in addition to infiltrating and establishing \"30 to 40 R AW operatives along the Makran Coast\" for involvement in terrorist activities. Jadhav said that R AW 's activities in Balochistan and Sindh were conducted under the direction of Anil Kumar Dhasmana. India's Foreign Ministry again dismissed the confession as \"false propaganda\", stating that Pakistan was trying to influence ICJ proceedings while denying the consular rights to Jadhav. ICJ did not allow Pakistan to play the video during the hearing. On 17 July 2019, the ICJ, in its verdict, rejected India's appeal for Jadhav's release and directed Pakistan to allow consular access and effectively Stayed the death sentence. The court ordered that Pakistan should grant consular access to Jhadav. Pakistan and India both claimed victory and welcomed the judgement of ICJ.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" He also admitted to supporting and funding, on behalf of R AW , Baloch militants affiliated with the BLA and BRA, in addition to infiltrating and establishing \"30 to 40 R AW operatives along the Makran Coast\" for involvement in terrorist activities.","after_edit":" He also admitted to supporting and funding, on behalf of  AW , Baloch militants affiliated with the BLA and BRA, in addition to infiltrating and establishing \"30 to 40 R AW operatives along the Makran Coast\" for involvement in terrorist activities.","start_sent_pos":2748,"end_sent_pos":2998,"raw_intents":["fluency","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}
{"doc_id":64904.0,"context":"A cannabis leaf The Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) launched its latest anti-cannabis propaganda campaign in Sydney today. The propaganda campaign, which specifically targets 14 to 19 year-olds aims to reduce the number of young people experimenting with the soft drug. The advertisements are the result of a tightening of cannabis laws in NSW last year. The propaganda , which NSW Health has cost at AUD$600,000 , that could of been spent on feeding starving children, will use a variety of print ads placed at bus stops and in youth magazines in addition to propaganda messages on websites such as MySpace and MSN. Propaganda ads use a tag line saying \"Pot. It mightn't kill you, but it could turn politicians into dickheads \". The propaganda images show a person staring from a black and white photo with quotes like \"You've got great eyes, dialated eyes are hot \" and \"I'd lend you money, but the government would just spend it on these ads \" , as part of an emotional appeal to manipulate the reader into an unfair bias on the topic, instead of comparing facts and science to the message they are promoting . The director of drug and alcohol programs with NSW Health, David McGrath said many young people know that cannabis was safe and its use was normal. \"There is still a significant cohort of people who think, particularly with the young person's age group, that cannabis is normal,\" Mr McGrath said. Mr McGrath said despite the number of young cannabis users had halved from forty percent to twenty percent, but claimed more needed to be done. \"We want to prevent people who are thinking about taking cannabis up from taking it up and also encouraging those people that are using cannabis to cease, through use of unrelenting lies and social shunning \" he said. Mr McGrath said young people had to be warned about the possible consequences of smoking cannabis, such as the alleged link with comedians and how it may improve social interaction and physical health. NSW Health Minister, Reba Meagher said a recent study indicated that while cannabis use among young people is in decline, almost one third of teenagers have tried cannabis. She also claimed that cannabis remained common within the community. \"Cannabis is a drug that is readily available in our community and it does not come with serious risk,\" she said.","domain":"news","before_edit":" \"We want to prevent people who are thinking about taking cannabis up from taking it up and also encouraging those people that are using cannabis to cease, through use of unrelenting lies and social shunning \" he said.","after_edit":" \"We want to prevent people who are thinking about taking cannabis up from taking it up and also encouraging those people that are using cannabis to cease,  \" he said.","start_sent_pos":1564,"end_sent_pos":1782,"raw_intents":["coherence","coherence","clarity"],"label":"coherence"}

The agreement was negotiated and concluded in Brussels under the auspices of the European Union and signed on 19 April 2013. Negotiations were led by Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Da\u010di\u0107 and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Tha\u00e7i and mediated by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton. The government of Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as a sovereign state, but began normalizing relations with the government of Kosovo nonetheless, in accordance with the Brussels URL In 2018, Serbia's president Aleksandar Vucic commented that the agreement is a difficult compromise for Serbia, which according to him fulfilled all of its obligations. Background Following the Kosovo War and NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Kosovo, as part of Serbia and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was placed under United Nations administration under UNSC Resolution 1244. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence and has since been recognized by 98 countries. However, Serbia maintains that Kosovo continues to be its territory. Kosovo has become a member of several international organizations, while according to Serbia and about half of the UN member states, Resolution 1244 remains legally binding on all parties. The EU-mediated dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia was launched in March 2011, three years after Kosovo declared URL Belgrade and Pristina were urged to continue talks in Brussels, but Serbia was not obliged to recognize Kosovo at any point in the URL Talks Until preset, ten rounds of talks have been held at the European External Action Service office in Brussels. Baroness Ashton, the EU High Representative, had been chairing talks for two years, followed by Federica Mogherini. Normalization of relations with neighboring states is a key precondition for states wishing to join the EU; the Brussels Agreement brought Serbia close to EU accession talks and Kosovo to initialing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). The SAA was signed by HR Mogherini and PM Mustafa in October 2015. Removing the parallel Serbian structures in the Northern part of Kosovo remains challenging. 330px|Ivica Da\u010di\u0107, Prime Minister of Serbia (left), Catherine Ashton (middle), and Hashim Tha\u00e7i, Prime Minister of Kosovo (right) in Munich, 2014.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton invited Baroness Ashton to undertake joint travel in the Balkans, and the two made joint visits to Belgrade and Pristina (as well as Sarajevo) in October 2012. Clinton assigned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State ambassador Philip Reeker to support Ashton's efforts. Reeker and his team coordinated closely with EU colleagues and met with Serbian and Kosovar representatives on the margins of every dialogue session in Brussels, and during visits to the region. The result was the 15-point \"First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalisation of Relations\", initialed but not signed on 19 April 2013.

We further observe that different encoding schemes used to obtain the representations lead to differences in whether these linguistic manifolds emerge in earlier or later layers of the network . In addition, we find that the emergence of linear separability in these manifolds is driven by a combined reduction of manifolds  radius, dimensionality and inter-manifold correlations.","domain":"arxiv","before_edit":" ANNs have subsequently become a popular model class to infer computational principles underlying complex cognitive functions, and in turn  they have also emerged as a natural testbed for applying methods originally developed to probe information in neural populations.","after_edit":" DNNs have subsequently become a popular model class to infer computational principles underlying complex cognitive functions, and in turn  they have also emerged as a natural testbed for applying methods originally developed to probe information in neural populations.","start_sent_pos":339,"end_sent_pos":608,"raw_intents":["meaning-changed","meaning-changed","meaning-changed"],"label":"meaning-changed"}

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 123. also spelled Malecite), are an Algonquian-speaking First Nation of the Wabanaki Confederacy. They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States . Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland . Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. Wlastkw means \"Beautiful River.\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. Wlastkwewiyik means \"People of the Beautiful River,\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007. Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years. Despite devastating population losses to European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, these Atlantic First Nations held on to their traditional coastal or river locations for hunting, fishing and gathering , and were concentrated along river valleys for trapping.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans.","after_edit":" The meaning of the word today is unknown but it is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans.","start_sent_pos":2053,"end_sent_pos":2295,"raw_intents":["coherence","fluency","fluency"],"label":"fluency"}

Pollen tube formation is important for sexual reproduction to occur in seed plants. Wind, water or pollinators transport pollen grains to the female gametophyte. Once a pollen grain has implanted on a compatible stigma via self-incompatibility mechanisms, the germination process is initiated. During this process, the pollen grain undergoes a conformational change whereupon a given section begins to protrude outwards to form a tube-like structure, known as the pollen tube. This structure rapidly descends down the length of the style via tip-directed growth, reaching rates of 1cm\/h, whilst carrying two non-motile sperm cells. Upon reaching the ovule the pollen tube ruptures, thereby delivering the sperm cells to the female gametophyte, ultimately resulting in a double fertilization event.

{"doc_id":33653387.0,"context":"In this way, Persian became a second language to many across North India;  Alam contends that it neared the status of a first language. By the 18th century, many Indians in the north of the subcontinent had a \"native speaker's competence in Persian\".Faruqi, Shamsur Rahman (2003), \"A Long History of Urdu Literarature, Part 1\", in Pollock (ed.), Literary cultures in history: reconstructions from South Asia, p. 849, Decline Following Aurangzeb's death, Persian began to fall into decline, being displaced by Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu). The arrival and strengthening of British political power added a growing influence of English as well. However, for a long time Persian was still the dominant language of the subcontinent, used in education, Muslim rule, the judiciary, and literature. The East India Company acknowledged Persian as a \"language of command\", necessary to communicate with and control the Indian population. Hence many British officials arriving in India learned Persian in colleges established by the Company. The teachers in these colleges were often Indian. In some cases, Britishers even took over as Persian professors, sidelining the role of the Indians. Deccan A Persian poem produced in the Deccan. 17th century.|346x346px Although considerably distanced from North India, the Deccan was also a recipient of Persian's linguistic impact. Persianate culture was brought to the Deccan fleetingly through the efforts of the Delhi Sultanate in the early 14th century. Persian finally gained a foothold in the region with the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate in 1347, which used the language for official purposes. The dynasty had a great interest in Persian culture, and several members were proficient in the language, producing their own literature. Literati from Northern India found themselves welcome at the court, and scholars from Iran were invited as well. Madrasas were built over the expanse of the kingdom, most notably the Mahmud Gawan Madrasa at Bidar, where Persian was taught.  In spite of this, Persian did not achieve the linguistic penetration it had in the north of the subcontinent. Richard Eaton writes that Persian was much less widely understood in the  region than vernacular languages  . During the turn of the 16th century, the Bahmani Sultanate splintered into the Deccan Sultanates, which were also Persianate in culture. They used Persian as a courtly language, as well as for official and administrative purposes. The language received literary patronage  . However, the sultans simultaneously promoted regional languages such as Telugu, Marathi, and Deccani (the southern variety of Hindustani), at times even using them in administration.  The reign of the Deccan Sultanates lasted until the late 17th century, when Aurangzeb brought the region into the Mughal Empire and established Aurangabad as the Deccan's capital. As was Mughal practice, Persian was used in many levels of administration. Major cities of this region that served as centres of Persian patronage included Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda. Notable Persian literature produced includes Futuh-us-Salatin, and the Bahmannamh . Influence on Indic languages As a prestige language and lingua franca over a period of 800 years in the Indian subcontinent, Classical Persian exerted a vast influence over numerous Indic languages. Generally speaking, the degree of impact is seen to increase the more one moves towards the north-west of the subcontinent, i.e. the Indo-Iranian frontier. For example, the Indo-Aryan languages have the most impact from Persian; this ranges from a high appearance in Punjabi, Sindhi, Kashmiri, and Gujarati, to more moderate representation in Bengali and Marathi. The largest foreign element in the Indo-Aryan languages is Persian. Conversely, the Dravidian languages have seen a low level of influence from Persian. They still feature loans from the language, some of which are direct, and some through Deccani (the southern variety of Hindustani), due to the Islamic rulers of the Deccan. Telugu is a good example of this (see Telangana Baasha for the Telugu dialect accentuated with these features).

His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered.

After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her.

In the picture is MTube, innovated by Science and Technology Advisory Group of Executive Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Computers and technology bring several conveniences to the modern lifestyle , but it creates risks like computer viruses and hacking. Many people want to enjoy the conveniences brought by new technology, but they may not be aware of its problems. WiMAX , which is a communication standard is mainly promoted by the Taipei Computer Association, in addition to the Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China , is considered by some to be the next generation in mobile devices. Since several Internet crimes are progressively respected by several information security companies , some of them disputed on security of WiMAX. After all, everyone wants to welcome this new technology but is afraid of its problem to bring about security issues. Although some (security) companies analyzed statistics on potential issues to dispute the future of WiMAX, but the question is how will they present their analysis? With opportunities from  two press conferences in Taiwan, Wikinews Journalist Rico Shen briefly and successively interviewed Hsiao-wen Hung, President of Microsoft Research Asia and Li Chang, Deputy Secretary General of Taipei Computer Association. With their experiences in the IT industry, they agreed to comment on this question. __NOTOC__ Hsiao-wen Hung: Information security isn't built within a day . Hsiao-wen Hung: The information security industry isn't built within a simple solution. (Interview audio clip) The improvements of information technology firmly brought on  opportunities, but information security is particularly respected by companies from security industry, As of this , how about the information security? Prior to the  (Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Server 2008) launch, although WiMAX, a next-generation networking technology, will bring on the growth of mobile users, but its future was ever disputed by some companies from information security industry. Hung: Safety and flexibility , its relation is like a paddle . If something wanted to be linkable anywhere, there were still some considerations on security . It's like a house which anyone can enter in it . If you want to ensure its safety on your house, you should doseveral hard works . That's why the security is a must-have trend in reality. As of information securitywhat you mentioned about before , relatively, if a newly-proposed future technology wasn't normally populated, it's a golden opportunity for companies when some security companies properly disputed on its future. Hung: Even though it's safe to lock everything all, but it is inconvenience to lock (them all) . Therefore, some key elements like encryption, password authentication, policy, and some Web 2.0 solutions played key roles in information security. There were some involuntary and deliberate attackers on the Internet , if anyone want to prevent them, a complete planning should do priory . That's why the information security industry is built with several solutions and long-term experiences but not a simple solution in a day.

{"doc_id":33653387.0,"context":"In this way, Persian became a second language to many across North India;  Alam contends that it neared the status of a first language. By the 18th century, many Indians in the north of the subcontinent had a \"native speaker's competence in Persian\".Faruqi, Shamsur Rahman (2003), \"A Long History of Urdu Literarature, Part 1\", in Pollock (ed.), Literary cultures in history: reconstructions from South Asia, p. 849, Decline Following Aurangzeb's death, Persian began to fall into decline, being displaced by Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu). The arrival and strengthening of British political power added a growing influence of English as well. However, for a long time Persian was still the dominant language of the subcontinent, used in education, Muslim rule, the judiciary, and literature. The East India Company acknowledged Persian as a \"language of command\", necessary to communicate with and control the Indian population. Hence many British officials arriving in India learned Persian in colleges established by the Company. The teachers in these colleges were often Indian. In some cases, Britishers even took over as Persian professors, sidelining the role of the Indians. Deccan A Persian poem produced in the Deccan. 17th century.|346x346px Although considerably distanced from North India, the Deccan was also a recipient of Persian's linguistic impact. Persianate culture was brought to the Deccan fleetingly through the efforts of the Delhi Sultanate in the early 14th century. Persian finally gained a foothold in the region with the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate in 1347, which used the language for official purposes. The dynasty had a great interest in Persian culture, and several members were proficient in the language, producing their own literature. Literati from Northern India found themselves welcome at the court, and scholars from Iran were invited as well. Madrasas were built over the expanse of the kingdom, most notably the Mahmud Gawan Madrasa at Bidar, where Persian was taught.  In spite of this, Persian did not achieve the linguistic penetration it had in the north of the subcontinent. Richard Eaton writes that Persian was much less widely understood in the  region than vernacular languages  . During the turn of the 16th century, the Bahmani Sultanate splintered into the Deccan Sultanates, which were also Persianate in culture. They used Persian as a courtly language, as well as for official and administrative purposes. The language received literary patronage  . However, the sultans simultaneously promoted regional languages such as Telugu, Marathi, and Deccani (the southern variety of Hindustani), at times even using them in administration.  The reign of the Deccan Sultanates lasted until the late 17th century, when Aurangzeb brought the region into the Mughal Empire and established Aurangabad as the Deccan's capital. As was Mughal practice, Persian was used in many levels of administration. Major cities of this region that served as centres of Persian patronage included Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda. Notable Persian literature produced includes Futuh-us-Salatin, and the Bahmannamh . Influence on Indic languages As a prestige language and lingua franca over a period of 800 years in the Indian subcontinent, Classical Persian exerted a vast influence over numerous Indic languages. Generally speaking, the degree of impact is seen to increase the more one moves towards the north-west of the subcontinent, i.e. the Indo-Iranian frontier. For example, the Indo-Aryan languages have the most impact from Persian; this ranges from a high appearance in Punjabi, Sindhi, Kashmiri, and Gujarati, to more moderate representation in Bengali and Marathi. The largest foreign element in the Indo-Aryan languages is Persian. Conversely, the Dravidian languages have seen a low level of influence from Persian. They still feature loans from the language, some of which are direct, and some through Deccani (the southern variety of Hindustani), due to the Islamic rulers of the Deccan. Telugu is a good example of this (see Telangana Baasha for the Telugu dialect accentuated with these features).

Some colleges and universities in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh offer Persian as a course of study.  Though Arabic largely dominates the realm of Islamic liturgy and theology in the Indian subcontinent, Persian can also be seen in some religious spheres: the dhikr sessions of Sufism often employ Persian poetry in song, and the Sufi devotional music genre of qawwali also uses Persian in parallel with local languages.

His early education was at Presentation College, Chaguanas, where he gained a Grade I Cambridge School Certificate. He later won a cadetship to the prestigious British Royal Military Academy Sandhurst between 1964 and 1966. As a Lieutenant in the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment, he led an army mutiny in 1970. In the midst of Black Power riots, the People's National Movement government led by Eric Williams proclaimed a State of Emergency April, 1970 and arrested several Black Power leaders and Trade Unionists. In a move to prevent Williams from using the military against the masses, a portion of the Regiment stationed at Teteron (on the Chaguaramas Peninsula), led by Lieutenants Shah and Rex Lassalle mutinied. In response, the Trinidad and Tobago Coast Guard fired on the mutineers who returned to Teteron Barracks, abandoning their foray into Port of Spain. After ten days the mutineers surrendered. The leaders were court-martialed and Shah and Lasalle were jailed. They both went on to win their appeals at the local Court of Appeal, and judges at the Privy Council in London, England, ruled against the State's appeal in July , 1972. Shah, Lassalle and all the other mutineers were freed within 24 hours of that ruling. After being released from prison Shah joined the Trade Union movement leading the ICFTU, a body of cane farmers who sought to displace the government URLanisation, TICFA . He , URLe Weekes and Basdeo Panday went on to found the United Labour Front  in 1975 as a labor confederation and transformed it into a political party in 1976. During general election later that year, the ULF secured 10 of the 36 seats in Parliament and became the official Opposition. Basdeo Panday was appointed Leader of the Opposition, but following a bitter row in the party, Shah was able to displace him, and served as Leader of the Opposition between August 9, 1977 and March 31, 1978 when Panday regained control of the party.

This structure rapidly descends down the length of the style via tip-directed growth, reaching rates of 1cm\/h, whilst carrying two non-motile sperm cells. Upon reaching the ovule the pollen tube ruptures, thereby delivering the sperm cells to the female gametophyte, ultimately resulting in a double fertilization event.

However, because the decoder predicts text tokens (such as characters or words) in an autoregressive manner, it is difficult for an AED model to predict all tokens in parallel.

The model aggregates encoded speech features into the hidden representations corresponding to each token with attention mechanisms. Thus, the model can capture the token relations by self-attention on the aggregated hidden representations from the whole speechsignal rather than autoregressive modeling on tokens . Without explicitly autoregressive language modeling, this model predicts all tokens in the sequence in parallel so that the inference is efficient.

Technological developments that affected the course of metal production were only feasible within a stable political environment, and this was not the case until the 9th century (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, a). During the first medieval centuries, the output of metal was in a steady decline and constraint in small scale activities. Miners adopted methods much less efficient than those of the Roman times. Ores were extracted only from shallow depths or from remnants of former abandoned mines. The vicinity of the mine to villages or towns was also a determinant factor when deciding about working on site , because of the high cost of material transportation (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, b). Apparently only the output of iron diminished less in relation to the other base and precious metals until the 8th century. This fact, correlated with the dramatic decrease in copper production, may indicate a possible displacement of copper and bronze artifacts by iron ones (Forbes 1957, 64; Bayley et al. 2008, 50). By the end of the 9th century, economic  and social conditions , that dictated the increased need of metal for agriculture, arms, stirrups and decoration, started to favor metallurgy and a slow but steady general progress was noted . Starting from the reign of the emperor Otto I in the 960s, smelting sites were multiplied. New mines were discovered and exploited, like the well-known Mines of Rammelsberg, close to the town of Goslar in the Harz Mountains.

As BeckhardOrganizational Development: strategies and models - Beckhard 1969 said in the preface to his seminal work  ... in our rapidly changing environment, URLanization forms must be developed; more effective goal-setting and planning processes must be learned, and practiced teams of independent people must spend real time improving their methods of working, decision-making and communicating. Competing or conflicting groups must move towards a collaborative way of work. In order for these changes to occur and be maintained, a planned, managed change effort is necessary - a program URLanizational development. Since the beginnings URLanizational development as a profession, diagnosis has moved from the purely behavioral towards a strategic and holistic business diagnostic approach, and from looking at human interventions in isolation to exploring the interactions of people in the context in which they operate.

Organizational development and in particular the diagnostic phase of activities is spreading from the occupational psychologists towards mainstream business.

They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States . Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland .

Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years.

Many particular instances of the principle are nevertheless provable there as well. There are many equivalent formulations of Markov's principle, as listed below. In computability theory In the language of computability theory, Markov's principle is a formal expression of the claim that if it is impossible that an algorithm does not terminate, then it does terminate. This is equivalent to the claim that if a set and its complement are both computably enumerable, then the set is decidable.   In constructive analysis It is equivalent, in the language of real analysis, to the following principles: Realizability If constructive arithmetic is translated using realizability into a classical meta-theory that proves the -consistency of the relevant classical theory (for example, Peano Arithmetic if we are studying Heyting arithmetic), then Markov's principle is justified: a realizer is the constant function that takes a realization that is not everywhere false to the unbounded search that successively checks if is true. If is not everywhere false, then by -consistency there must be a term for which holds, and each term will be checked by the search eventually. If however does not hold anywhere, then the domain of the constant function must be empty, so although the search does not halt it still holds vacuously that the function is a realizer. By the Law of the Excluded Middle (in our classical metatheory), must either hold nowhere or not hold nowhere, therefore this constant function is a realizer. If instead the realizability interpretation is used in a constructive meta-theory, then it is not justified. Indeed, for first-order arithmetic, Markov's principle exactly captures the difference between a constructive and classical meta-theory. Specifically, a statement is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Heyting arithmetic; and it is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis and Markov's principle if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Peano arithmetic .","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" If instead the realizability interpretation is used in a constructive meta-theory, then it is not justified.

Computers and technology bring several conveniences to the modern lifestyle , but it creates risks like computer viruses and hacking. Many people want to enjoy the conveniences brought by new technology, but they may not be aware of its problems. WiMAX , which is a communication standard is mainly promoted by the Taipei Computer Association, in addition to the Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China , is considered by some to be the next generation in mobile devices. Since several Internet crimes are progressively respected by several information security companies , some of them disputed on security of WiMAX. After all, everyone wants to welcome this new technology but is afraid of its problem to bring about security issues. Although some (security) companies analyzed statistics on potential issues to dispute the future of WiMAX, but the question is how will they present their analysis? With opportunities from  two press conferences in Taiwan, Wikinews Journalist Rico Shen briefly and successively interviewed Hsiao-wen Hung, President of Microsoft Research Asia and Li Chang, Deputy Secretary General of Taipei Computer Association.

Prior to the  (Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Server 2008) launch, although WiMAX, a next-generation networking technology, will bring on the growth of mobile users, but its future was ever disputed by some companies from information security industry. Hung: Safety and flexibility , its relation is like a paddle . If something wanted to be linkable anywhere, there were still some considerations on security . It's like a house which anyone can enter in it . If you want to ensure its safety on your house, you should doseveral hard works . That's why the security is a must-have trend in reality. As of information securitywhat you mentioned about before , relatively, if a newly-proposed future technology wasn't normally populated, it's a golden opportunity for companies when some security companies properly disputed on its future. Hung: Even though it's safe to lock everything all, but it is inconvenience to lock (them all) . Therefore, some key elements like encryption, password authentication, policy, and some Web 2.0 solutions played key roles in information security. There were some involuntary and deliberate attackers on the Internet , if anyone want to prevent them, a complete planning should do priory .

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected.","after_edit":" Historians no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected.","start_sent_pos":2237,"end_sent_pos":2347,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","style"],"label":"clarity"}

There are two findings: 1) Trained NLU models have strong preference for features located at the head of the long-tailed distribution, and 2) Shortcut features are picked up during very early few iterations of the model training. These two observations are further employed to formulate a measurement which can quantify the shortcut degree of each training sample. Based on this shortcut measurement, we propose a shortcut mitigation framework  , to suppress the model from making overconfident predictions for samples with large shortcut degree.

Zheng dynasts used the newly-owned island as part of the loyalist movement aiming to reclaim the mainland China from the Qing, mainly as a base of military operationsbut also deepening the process of Sinicization on Taiwan, in an effort to consolidate the last stronghold of Han Chinese resistance against the invading Manchus. \"Historical and Legal Aspects of the International Status of Taiwan (Formosa)\" by Ng Yuzin Chiautong, published on August 28, 1971, WUFI Until its annexation by the Qing dynasty in 1683, the kingdom was ruled by Koxinga's heirs, the House of Koxinga , and the period of rule is sometimes referred to as the Koxinga dynasty .

But there are also proposals to connect the two, for example, the Lockean thesis, which defines belief as credence above a certain threshold. Justification plays a central role in traditional epistemology while Bayesians have focused on the related notions of confirmation and disconfirmation through evidence. The notion of evidence is important for both approaches but only the traditional approach has been interested in studying the sources of evidence, like perception and memory. Bayesianism, on the other hand, has focused on the role of evidence for rationality: how someone's credence should be adjusted upon receiving new evidence.

{"doc_id":55503854.0,"context":"Relation to traditional epistemology Traditional epistemology and Bayesian epistemology are both forms of epistemology, but they differ in various respects, for example, concerning their methodology, the propositional attitudes they study , the role justification or confirmation plays in them and some of their research interests. Bayesian epistemology focuses on degrees of belief, also often called credences. On the other hand, Traditional epistemology focuses on knowledge, analyzed by Plato as being justified true beliefs . They then seek to understand what counts as knowledgeand how to evaluate one's beliefs (see foundationalism, coherentism, and the problem of philosophical skepticism or the question of whether knowledge is possible at all ) . Bayesian epistemology, on the other hand, works by formalizing concepts and problems, which are often vague in the traditional approach. It thereby focuses more on mathematical intuitions and promises a higher degree of precision. It sees belief as a continuous phenomenon that comes in various degrees, so-called credences. Some Bayesians have even suggested that the regular notion of belief should be abandoned. But there are also proposals to connect the two, for example, the Lockean thesis, which defines belief as credence above a certain threshold. Justification plays a central role in traditional epistemology while Bayesians have focused on the related notions of confirmation and disconfirmation through evidence. The notion of evidence is important for both approaches but only the traditional approach has been interested in studying the sources of evidence, like perception and memory. Bayesianism, on the other hand, has focused on the role of evidence for rationality: how someone's credence should be adjusted upon receiving new evidence. There is an analogy between the Bayesian norms of rationality in terms of probabilistic laws and the traditional norms of rationality in terms of deductive consistency.

{"doc_id":106849.0,"context":"A New Jersey state appeals court ruled Tuesday that fifteen Spanish citizens can sue over claims of health issues related to asbestos exposure while working aboard United States Navy and Coast Guard ships docked at United States-Spanish military installations. The defendant, Ohio-based company Owens Illinois, Inc., had sought a trial in a Spanish court, an opinion which was shared by the Superior Court which heard the case  . The three-judge panel appellate court overturned the decision of the Superior Court in a 3-0 ruling. Asbestos fibers The Spanish citizens worked aboard U.S. ships between 1950 and 1998, and claim  they were exposed to asbestos dust and fibers from piping insulation produced by Owens-Illinois. The piping insulation was originally manufactured in Sayreville, Middlesex County, and Berlin, Camden County  New Jersey. The workers say they suffer from diseases related to asbestos such as asbestosis. Owens-Illinois has headquarters in Toledo, Ohio and is a Delaware corporation. The New Jersey appellate panel ruled that the Superior Court judge did not consider where the plaintiffs wanted their case heard, and also held that the U.S. ships are considered U.S. territory and thus the workers' claimed health issues did not begin on Spanish land. Attorneys for Owens-Illinois argued that U.S. ships when docked are subject to the law of Spain, and that the case should be heard in Spanish courts. The court's opinion was written by Judge Anthony Parrillo, who wrote that : \"In sum, we conclude that defendant has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that Spain is an available adequate forum to adjudicate the parties' dispute and therefore the motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds should have been denied without consideration of public- and private-interest factors.\" The decision reversed the ruling of the Superior Court and remanded the suit back to that court for trial. This is not the only asbestos-related lawsuit in which Owens-Illinois is cited as a defendant. The company is also a defendant (among other defendants) in asbestos cases filed in Ohio and other states. In an April 30 press release the company reported that asbestos-related payments had decreased slightly, stating: \"Asbestos-related cash payments during the first quarter of 2008 were $40.2 million, down slightly from $41.0 million during the first quarter of 2007.\" According to the press release  the company had 14,000 pending asbestos-related lawsuits as of March 31, 2008. In its balance sheet for the first quarter of 2008  the company reported US$835 million in asbestos-related liabilities. In a May 2 earnings call with financial analysts, Owens-Illinois Chief Financial Officer Edward C. White addressed asbestos-related expenses. \"Only a small portion of our first quarter asbestos payments related to the company's proactive legal strategy to reduce risk and accelerate asbestos resolution on favorable terms. Nevertheless, this strategy continues and additional expected spending is reflected both on the current liability portion of our balance sheet as well as in our full-year cash flow projection,\" said White. He went on to note that: \"We exited the business 50 years ago and have been dealing with the legal issues for almost 30 years. For OI, this remains a limited declining liability, which we will continue to manage in a conscientious and responsible manner.\" Asbestosis is a disease resulting from asbestos exposure which causes lung scarring and can lead to lung cancer. Exposure to asbestos can also lead to a more serious condition known as mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a cancer which develops in the sac surrounding the lungs and chest cavity, abdominal cavity, or the sac surrounding the heart. Patients with malignant mesothelioma generally do not have positive outcomes, and once diagnosed  have six months to a year to live.","domain":"news","before_edit":" In an April 30 press release the company reported that asbestos-related payments had decreased slightly, stating: \"Asbestos-related cash payments during the first quarter of 2008 were $40.2 million, down slightly from $41.0 million during the first quarter of 2007.\" According to the press release  the company had 14,000 pending asbestos-related lawsuits as of March 31, 2008.","after_edit":" In an April 30 press release the company reported that asbestos-related payments had decreased slightly, stating: \"Asbestos-related cash payments during the first quarter of 2008 were $40.2 million, down slightly from $41.0 million during the first quarter of 2007.\" According to the press release , the company had 14,000 pending asbestos-related lawsuits as of March 31, 2008.","start_sent_pos":2125,"end_sent_pos":2503,"raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","coherence"],"label":"fluency"}

The Associated Press reports a second related death from a traffic accident. 30 mobile homes have been destroyed. Authorities expect to order more evacuations before the fires can be brought under control. Fires started Sunday due to Santa Ana wind conditions in the San Fernando Valley and Angeles National Forest on the northern outskirts of Los Angeles. Affected communities include Porter Ranch and the Lopez Canyon area. The confirmed fatality was an unidentified transient who had been using a cardboard shelter beneath a freeway overpass. Santa Ana winds as strong as 65 miles per hour fanned the flames, which jumped the eight lane 210 Freeway. Both the 210 Freeway and 118 Freeway were closed during Monday morning rush hour.

Many people want to enjoy the conveniences brought by new technology, but they may not be aware of its problems. WiMAX , which is a communication standard is mainly promoted by the Taipei Computer Association, in addition to the Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China , is considered by some to be the next generation in mobile devices. Since several Internet crimes are progressively respected by several information security companies , some of them disputed on security of WiMAX. After all, everyone wants to welcome this new technology but is afraid of its problem to bring about security issues. Although some (security) companies analyzed statistics on potential issues to dispute the future of WiMAX, but the question is how will they present their analysis? With opportunities from  two press conferences in Taiwan, Wikinews Journalist Rico Shen briefly and successively interviewed Hsiao-wen Hung, President of Microsoft Research Asia and Li Chang, Deputy Secretary General of Taipei Computer Association.

Hsiao-wen Hung: The information security industry isn't built within a simple solution.

Prior to the  (Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Server 2008) launch, although WiMAX, a next-generation networking technology, will bring on the growth of mobile users, but its future was ever disputed by some companies from information security industry. Hung: Safety and flexibility , its relation is like a paddle . If something wanted to be linkable anywhere, there were still some considerations on security . It's like a house which anyone can enter in it . If you want to ensure its safety on your house, you should doseveral hard works . That's why the security is a must-have trend in reality. As of information securitywhat you mentioned about before , relatively, if a newly-proposed future technology wasn't normally populated, it's a golden opportunity for companies when some security companies properly disputed on its future. Hung: Even though it's safe to lock everything all, but it is inconvenience to lock (them all) . Therefore, some key elements like encryption, password authentication, policy, and some Web 2.0 solutions played key roles in information security. There were some involuntary and deliberate attackers on the Internet , if anyone want to prevent them, a complete planning should do priory . That's why the information security industry is built with several solutions and long-term experiences but not a simple solution in a day.

When a new technology was under development, companies mostly looked on its vision rather than its hidden factors like information or data security.

{"doc_id":172474.0,"context":"Exercise and lactate During power exercises such as sprinting, when the rate of demand for energy is high, glucose is broken down and oxidized to pyruvate , and lactate is then produced from the pyruvate faster than the body can process it, causing lactate concentrations to rise.  The production of lactate is beneficial for NAD+ regeneration (pyruvate is reduced to lactate while NADH is oxidized to NAD+), which is used up in oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate during production of pyruvate from glucose, and this ensures that energy production is maintained and exercise can continue. During intense exercise, the respiratory chain cannot keep up with the amount of hydrogen ions that join to form NADH, and cannot regenerate NAD+ quickly enough. However, lactate is continually formed at rest and during all exercise intensities. With the use of stable isotopic tracers URLe Brooks and colleagues, at the University of California, Berkeley, observed that lactate served as a metabolic fuel being produced and oxidatively disposed in resting and exercising muscle. Some causes of this are metabolism in red blood cells that lack mitochondria, and limitations resulting from the enzyme activity that occurs in muscle fibers having high glycolytic capacity. In 2004, Robergs et al. maintained that lactic acidosis during exercise is a \"construct\" or myth, pointing out that part of the H+ comes from ATP hydrolysis (ATP4 + H2O ADP3 + + H+), and that reducing pyruvate to lactate (pyruvate + NADH + H+ lactate + NAD+) actually consumes H+. Lindinger et al. countered that they had ignored the causative factors of the increase in [H+]. After all, the production of lactate from a neutral molecule must increase [H+] to maintain electroneutrality. The point of Robergs's paper, however, was that lactate is produced from pyruvate, which has the same charge. It is pyruvate production from neutral glucose that generates H+: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Subsequent lactate production absorbs these protons: 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH 2 + 2NAD+ Overall: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O 2 + 2NAD+ + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Although the reaction glucose 2lactate + 2H+ releases two H+ when viewed on its own, the H+ are absorbed in the production of ATP. On the other hand, the absorbed acidity is released during subsequent hydrolysis of ATP: ATP4 + H2O ADP3 + + H+. So once the use of ATP is included, the overall reaction is C6H12O6 2 + 2H+","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"Exercise and lactate During power exercises such as sprinting, when the rate of demand for energy is high, glucose is broken down and oxidized to pyruvate , and lactate is then produced from the pyruvate faster than the body can process it, causing lactate concentrations to rise.","after_edit":"Exercise and lactate During power exercises such as sprinting, when the rate of demand for energy is high, glucose is broken down and oxidized to pyruvate .

Johnson, 38, of Kingsford, Michigan was charged on Wednesday with killing three teenagers in a shooting on the Menominee River near Niagara, Wisconsin. Johnson was charged with first-degree intentional homicide. Authorities say he went to the popular bathing spot near the East Kingsford Railroad Bridge on July 31 and opened fire with a military-style rifle, killing three and injuring one. The Associated Press reports that he faces life in prison without parole if convicted . Wisconsin does not have the death penalty. However, as one of the bodies was found on the Michigan side of the border, he could potentially face charges there, or perhaps even in federal court. He is being represented by a public defender, Len Kachinsky. Local teens said Johnson often was seen at the site, but mostly kept to himself. On July 31, the Associated Press reports  he emerged from the woods wearing camouflage clothing and opened fire without saying a word. Johnson fled and surrendered the next day after a multi-agency manhunt. Johnson had been accused of a sexual assault, and his mother speculated he may have panicked after hearing police wanted to speak with him. The Detroit Free Press reports that  in a confession to police, Johnson said the shooting was set in motion when Johnson lured the woman to the bridge the day before and sexually assaulted her. Worried that he would be arrested, Johnson returned to the woods, planning to ambush law enforcement officers coming to find him. After he spent a night in the woods and no officers came, he returned home at 10 a.m.  on July 31, asked his mother if police had been looking for him, then left at 3:00 p.m. He says he then got his weapons and returned to the woods. Johnson said he planned to wait for the teens to reach the Michigan side of the river so he could kill them all and use them as \"bait\" to lure police into his ambush. However, Spigarelli and Pohlson unexpectedly approached his position, and he said he felt trapped and he opened fire. Spigarelli and Pohlson were both shot in the head and died instantly. Johnson then reloaded and fired across the river, killing Bryan Mort.","domain":"news","before_edit":" Johnson was charged with first-degree intentional homicide.","after_edit":" The charges consist of three counts of first-degree intentional homicide.","start_sent_pos":194,"end_sent_pos":254,"raw_intents":["meaning-changed","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 123. also spelled Malecite), are an Algonquian-speaking First Nation of the Wabanaki Confederacy. They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States . Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland . Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. Wlastkw means \"Beautiful River.\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. Wlastkwewiyik means \"People of the Beautiful River,\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007. Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years. Despite devastating population losses to European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, these Atlantic First Nations held on to their traditional coastal or river locations for hunting, fishing and gathering , and were concentrated along river valleys for trapping.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland .

This fact, and other linguistic considerations, have led experts to believe that Digor dialect became separated from Proto-Ossetian during the Mongol conquests. In \"Ashkharatsuyts\" Ashtigors are given separately from Alans - the ancestors of present-day Ossetians. Also starting from the 18th century  the ethnonym digor is widely used by travelers and in Russian official documents. Based on these facts, Ossetian Soviet linguist-Iranist Vasily Abaev suppose that the Digors could be an iranized Circassian tribe and the first part of the name - dig- can have the same roots with the Circassian endonym Adyge and -or can be just a prefix for plurality as in many contemporary Caucasian languages.

{"doc_id":172474.0,"context":"Exercise and lactate During power exercises such as sprinting, when the rate of demand for energy is high, glucose is broken down and oxidized to pyruvate . Lactate is then produced from the pyruvate faster than the body can process it, causing lactate concentrations to rise. Lactate is the end product of glycolysis and increased circulating levels of lactate are associated with increased muscle glycogen breakdown with exercise. Circulating lactate levels have been found higher in heat-sensitive patients with variants in genes encoding the skeletal muscle calcium release channel, as compared to asymptomatic carriers of the same variants. The production of lactate is beneficial for NAD+ regeneration (pyruvate is reduced to lactate while NADH is oxidized to NAD+), which is used up in oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate during production of pyruvate from glucose, and this ensures that energy production is maintained and exercise can continue. During intense exercise, the respiratory chain cannot keep up with the amount of hydrogen ions that join to form NADH, and cannot regenerate NAD+ quickly enough. Lactate served as a metabolic fuel being produced and oxidatively disposed in resting and exercising muscle.  In 2004, Robergs et al. maintained that lactic acidosis during exercise is a \"construct\" or myth, pointing out that part of the H+ comes from ATP hydrolysis (ATP4 + H2O ADP3 + + H+), and that reducing pyruvate to lactate (pyruvate + NADH + H+ lactate + NAD+) actually consumes H+. Lindinger et al. countered that they had ignored the causative factors of the increase in [H+]. After all, the production of lactate from a neutral molecule must increase [H+] to maintain electroneutrality. The point of Robergs's paper, however, was that lactate is produced from pyruvate, which has the same charge. It is pyruvate production from neutral glucose that generates H+: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Subsequent lactate production absorbs these protons: 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH 2 + 2NAD+ Overall: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O 2 + 2NAD+ + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Although the reaction glucose 2lactate + 2H+ releases two H+ when viewed on its own, the H+ are absorbed in the production of ATP.

The second group of needs is those of relatedness the desire people have for maintaining important interpersonal relationships. These social and status desires require interaction with others if they are to be satisfied, and they align with Maslow's social need and the external component of Maslow's esteem classification. Finally, Alderfer isolates growth needs: an intrinsic desire for personal development. These include the intrinsic component from Maslow's esteem category and the characteristics included under self-actualization. Alderfer categorized the lower order needs (Physiological and Safety) into the Existence category. He fit Maslow's interpersonal love and esteem needs into the Relatedness category.

The French composer Reynaldo Hahn noticed how much Marcel Proust \"vivait la musique de son temps\" (experienced contemporary music).See Adrien De Vries' article : Sources de la Sonate de Vinteuil, April 2007 (in French) For example, Proust immediately praised and enjoyed Debussy's 1902 Pellas et Mlisande opera. Critics disagree on which composer inspired the sonata. Possibly Gabriel FaurSee Margaret Hunter and Abigail Al-Doory's article: L'homme et la Musique Dans Un Amour de Swann, 1996 or Csar Franck. In Les plaisirs et les jours (1896), Proust focusses on Hans Sachs's monologue from Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nrnberg, act 2. In Jean Santeuil (1952), a Camille Saint-Sans sonata for violin and piano (Op. 75, 1885) plays a key role and is presumably the model for the Sonate de Vinteuil. In Un amour de Swann  , the Vinteuil Sonata is played during evenings at the Verdurins' by pianist Dechambre. The main character's emotions are mirrored by Proust's musical reminiscences.

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered. On June 15th, the body of 45-year-old Joanne O'Rourke was found. Arrest Atkins was arrested on rape charges on August 21, 1992, after he was identified on a Detroit street by 34-year-old Darlene Saunders, who had been sodomized and raped by him in October 1991. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% He was questioned again, but categorically denied any involvement, claiming that he had no interest in women and was a homosexual. After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her. In several cases, he was unable to explain why he committed the murders: this was the case with Hardy, with whom Benjamin had an intimate relationship, but after doing drugs together, he said he strangled her for no apparent reason.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith.","after_edit":" He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the  10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith.","start_sent_pos":4102,"end_sent_pos":4315,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

These LMsrequire expensive computing resources for self-supervised or un-supervised learning from huge unlabelled text corpora. The information learned is transferred through so-called embeddings to downstream prediction tasks. Bioinformatics provide vast gold-mines of structured and sequentially ordered text data leading to extraordinarily successful protein sequence LMs that promise new frontiers for generative and predictive tasks at low inference cost . Here, we addressed two questions: (1) To which extent can HPC up-scale protein LMs to larger databases and larger models? (2) To which extent can LMs extract features from single proteins to get closer to the performance of methods using evolutionary information? Methodology: Here, we trained two auto-regressive language models (Transformer-XL and XLNet) and two auto-encoder models ( BERT and Albert) using 80 billion amino acids from 200 million protein sequences (UniRef100) and 393 billion amino acids  from 2.1 billion protein sequences ( BFD ). The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer , using 5616 GPUs  and one TPU Pod , using V3-512 cores. Results: The results of training these LMs on proteins was assessed by predicting secondary structure in three- and eight-states ( Q3= 75-83, Q8= 63-72), localization for 10 cellular compartments (Q10=74) and whether a protein is membrane-bound or water-soluble (Q2=89).

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered. On June 15th, the body of 45-year-old Joanne O'Rourke was found. Arrest Atkins was arrested on rape charges on August 21, 1992, after he was identified on a Detroit street by 34-year-old Darlene Saunders, who had been sodomized and raped by him in October 1991. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% He was questioned again, but categorically denied any involvement, claiming that he had no interest in women and was a homosexual. After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her. In several cases, he was unable to explain why he committed the murders: this was the case with Hardy, with whom Benjamin had an intimate relationship, but after doing drugs together, he said he strangled her for no apparent reason.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions.","after_edit":" Due to this, both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions.","start_sent_pos":780,"end_sent_pos":873,"raw_intents":["coherence","coherence","clarity"],"label":"coherence"}

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed.","after_edit":" Either each volume would  be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed.","start_sent_pos":355,"end_sent_pos":586,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"],"label":"clarity"}

Clinton assigned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State ambassador Philip Reeker to support Ashton's efforts. Reeker and his team coordinated closely with EU colleagues and met with Serbian and Kosovar representatives on the margins of every dialogue session in Brussels, and during visits to the region.

Such alignment-based approaches are both intuitive and interpretable; however, they are empirically inferior to the simple cosine similarity between general-purpose sentence vectors. To remedy this , we focus on  the fact that the norm of word vectors is a good proxy for word importance, and the angle of them is a good proxy for word similarity. Alignment-based approaches do not distinguish the norm and direction , whereas sentence-vector approaches automatically use the norm as the word importance. Accordingly, we propose to decouple word vectors into their norm and direction then computing the alignment-based similarity using earth mover's distance (  optimal transport cost), which we refer to as word rotator's distance. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to grow the norm and direction of word vectors (vector converter) ; this is a new systematic approach derived from the sentence-vector estimation methods , which can significantly improve the performance of the proposed method .

There are six types, all of which are composed of long and thin fibrous crystals, each fibre being composed of many microscopic \"fibrils\" that can be released into the atmosphere by abrasion and other processes. Asbestos is an excellent electrical insulator and is highly heat-resistant, so for many years it was used as a building material.Bureau of Naval Personnel, Basic Electricity. 1969: US Navy. However, it is now a notorious health and safety hazard and the use of asbestos as a building material is illegal in many countries. Inhalation of asbestos fibres can lead to various serious lung conditions, including asbestosis and cancer  . Archaeological studies have found evidence of asbestos being used as far back as the Stone Age to strengthen ceramic pots, but large-scale mining began at the end of the 19th century when manufacturers and builders began using asbestos for its desirable physical properties. Asbestos was widely used during the 20th century until the 1970s when public recognition of the health hazards of asbestos dust led to its prohibition in mainstream  construction and fireproofing in most countries.

{"doc_id":29305513.0,"context":"Legacy of nationalization of history Nation mythologies, histories and states An ancient Finnish Hero Illustration from Kalevala One of the most important consequences of printed texts of nationalized history was that it provided a basis for national revivals in the process of creating modern nations. Projects of national awakenings captured nationalized history and turned it into a weapon of popularization of national myths in the period of establishing history as a social scientific discipline. A shortcut to production of national mythologies that proves ancient origins of modern nations, providing them with a respectable past, was URLery of historical documents, literature and historical works that were lost for some time, and then suddenly rediscovered to the approval of an astonished grateful public. Authors of such rediscovered treasures that were in a quest for success and glory did not suspect that they were in fact builders of as yet nonexistent modern nations. Even when it was obvious that certain texts were basically invented national myths, many social groups, and even intellectuals, wanted to believe that they were authentic national epics, like the Kalevala in Finland. The nationalization of history, which had its origins more in the epics and tendentious oratory than in philosophy, sometimes grew the idea of an esprit des peuples or national spirit , and , later still , the idea that each nation had a 'mission'. Such ideas did not evolve into groups of associated individuals, but into universal spirits that is said to be able to destroy individuals and nations. Nationalization of history was an important element of national revival and creating new nation states in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. New nation states and their institutions had the most important role in social process of the professionalization and institutionalization of history that was additionally supporting the process of nationalization of history. The final consequence was that national history regarded the nation-state as the primary unit of historical analysis. Society and nature 250px|State entities on the former territory of Yugoslavia, 2008. Nationalization of history affects all aspects of life, from relationships with other nationalities to architecture. This is a result of the fact that nationalization of history corresponds with nationalization of nature , and the fact that reservations and hostilities toward other nations accompanied nationalism from the beginning. At the end of the 20th century there were extreme nationalistic interpretations of Balkan and Caucasus history, which became powerful weapons in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.Pakier, Strth; p. 39, \"In the Balkan and Caucasian parts of Europe, history in extreme nationalistic interpretations developed into powerful weapon in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multi-national states like Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.\" After disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, besides the process of renationalization of history, there is sometimes also retroactive nationalization of victims or tragedies of the people that in past lived in those states. According to new national historical narratives, the reason for some people were the victims of certain tragedies was because they were of a certain nationality, for example the Ukrainians of the Soviet Union.Zhurzhenko, The geopolitics of memory, \" An important consequence of the delegitimization of the Soviet historical narrative and the (re-)construction of national histories after 1991 is the retroactive nationalization of victims.... According to the new national historical narrative, they were killed by the Soviet regime because they were Ukrainians  \" Nationalist discourse in Croatia presents the aftermath of Bleiburg repatriations as an event where only Croatians suffered and died just because they were Croatians , eluding the fact that many of the victims were Serbs, Montenegrins or Slovenians while many Croatians had died while fighting as collaborators against Yugoslav partisans. Denationalization of history Nationalization of history has been increasingly called into question, and one of its consequences is the emerging of processes of denationalization of history, which is the result of an intention to change the perspective of creating works about history by promoting pluralism and international standards in social sciences. In Central and Eastern Europe there are tensions between nationalization of history and the process of European integrations. That is one of reasons URLanized activities aimed toward denationalization of history.

Dismissing threats of legal action by the hunting industry, Marthinus Van Schalkwyk said the new law would ban \"canned\" hunting of big predators and rhinos in small enclosures that offer them no means of escape. In addition, lions bred in captivity would have to be released into the open for at least two years before they could be hunted. Van Schalkwyk said a previously proposed six-month delay would not give lions enough time to develop self-defence instincts. \"Hunting should be about fair chase ... testing the wits of a hunter against that of the animal,\" he told a press conference. \"Over the years that got eroded and now we are trying to re-establish that principle.\" This measure was later overturned. In May 2007 a much-reported hunting trip involved the killing of 1,051pound pet pig in an alleged canned hunt. The pig was named \"Monster Pig\" by the media and it was believed that the pig was a feral hog . It was soon discovered that the pig, previously named \"Fred , \"  had been someone's pet and was then sold to a hunting facility only a brief time before he was killed. On May 3, paying customers Mike Stone and his 11-year-old son , Jamison , hunted him in a fenced enclosure. Jamison shot Fred a total of eight times over a period of three hours. A June 2007 story on CNN detailed canned hunting in South Africa and includes a video of a canned lion hunt where the animal is shot against a fence. On November 30, 2014, CBS  60 Minutes broadcast a story (\"The Lion Whisperer\") about one man's sanctuary in South Africa for 26 lions, raised in captivity, who he rescued from the fate of canned lion hunting. In November 2015, the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa (PHASA) voted to disassociate itself from the practice of canned lion hunting in South Africa. Unless the conservation value of canned lion hunting is demonstrated to PHASA, URLanization will remain against the practice and, under penalty of expulsion, no PHASA members will be permitted to participate canned lion hunts. In November 2017  PHASA came under fire over the body's reversal of its 2015 policy against the hunting of captive-bred lions.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country.","after_edit":" In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk,  announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country.","start_sent_pos":715,"end_sent_pos":885,"raw_intents":["coherence","coherence","clarity"],"label":"coherence"}

In the picture is MTube, innovated by Science and Technology Advisory Group of Executive Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan). Computers and technology bring several conveniences to the modern lifestyle , but it creates risks like computer viruses and hacking. Many people want to enjoy the conveniences brought by new technology, but they may not be aware of its problems. WiMAX , which is a communication standard is mainly promoted by the Taipei Computer Association, in addition to the Industrial Technology Research Institute and the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Republic of China , is considered by some to be the next generation in mobile devices. Since several Internet crimes are progressively respected by several information security companies , some of them disputed on security of WiMAX. After all, everyone wants to welcome this new technology but is afraid of its problem to bring about security issues. Although some (security) companies analyzed statistics on potential issues to dispute the future of WiMAX, but the question is how will they present their analysis? With opportunities from  two press conferences in Taiwan, Wikinews Journalist Rico Shen briefly and successively interviewed Hsiao-wen Hung, President of Microsoft Research Asia and Li Chang, Deputy Secretary General of Taipei Computer Association. With their experiences in the IT industry, they agreed to comment on this question. __NOTOC__ Hsiao-wen Hung: Information security isn't built within a day . Hsiao-wen Hung: The information security industry isn't built within a simple solution. (Interview audio clip) The improvements of information technology firmly brought on  opportunities, but information security is particularly respected by companies from security industry, As of this , how about the information security? Prior to the  (Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Server 2008) launch, although WiMAX, a next-generation networking technology, will bring on the growth of mobile users, but its future was ever disputed by some companies from information security industry. Hung: Safety and flexibility , its relation is like a paddle . If something wanted to be linkable anywhere, there were still some considerations on security . It's like a house which anyone can enter in it . If you want to ensure its safety on your house, you should doseveral hard works . That's why the security is a must-have trend in reality. As of information securitywhat you mentioned about before , relatively, if a newly-proposed future technology wasn't normally populated, it's a golden opportunity for companies when some security companies properly disputed on its future. Hung: Even though it's safe to lock everything all, but it is inconvenience to lock (them all) . Therefore, some key elements like encryption, password authentication, policy, and some Web 2.0 solutions played key roles in information security. There were some involuntary and deliberate attackers on the Internet , if anyone want to prevent them, a complete planning should do priory . That's why the information security industry is built with several solutions and long-term experiences but not a simple solution in a day. Li Chang: Convergences will be brought for security and IT industries . Li Chang: Convergences will be brought for security and IT industries besides of changes on WiMAX. (Interview audio clip) What's your opinion on several disputes from IS companies during the \"2008 Asia-pacific Information Security Forum\"? Chang: Our member companies will do attempts on trend-changing. As of our board committee, because (our member) companies mostly manufactured notebook computers, if a common consensus from several senior officers from IT industrywill be established , I think the objects of TCA will be more and more cleared . What's your opinion on Hsiao-wen Hung's word, \"When people want to enjoy a new technology, some protections should be necessity \"? Chang: It's an undoubted truth. When a new technology was under development, companies mostly looked on its vision rather than its hidden factors like information or data security. As the Internet just began in a mature infrastructure, the public might not know its critical issue on security factor.

As mining gradually became a task for specialized craftsmen, miners moved in large groups and they formed settlements with their own customs close to mines. They were always welcomed by the regional authorities  since the latter were interested in increasing the revenue and the exploitation of the mineral-rich subsurface was quite profitable.

{"doc_id":106849.0,"context":"A New Jersey state appeals court ruled Tuesday that fifteen Spanish citizens can sue over claims of health issues related to asbestos exposure while working aboard United States Navy and Coast Guard ships docked at United States-Spanish military installations. The defendant, Ohio-based company Owens Illinois, Inc., had sought a trial in a Spanish court, an opinion which was shared by the Superior Court which heard the case  . The three-judge panel appellate court overturned the decision of the Superior Court in a 3-0 ruling. Asbestos fibers The Spanish citizens worked aboard U.S. ships between 1950 and 1998, and claim  they were exposed to asbestos dust and fibers from piping insulation produced by Owens-Illinois. The piping insulation was originally manufactured in Sayreville, Middlesex County, and Berlin, Camden County  New Jersey. The workers say they suffer from diseases related to asbestos such as asbestosis. Owens-Illinois has headquarters in Toledo, Ohio and is a Delaware corporation. The New Jersey appellate panel ruled that the Superior Court judge did not consider where the plaintiffs wanted their case heard, and also held that the U.S. ships are considered U.S. territory and thus the workers' claimed health issues did not begin on Spanish land. Attorneys for Owens-Illinois argued that U.S. ships when docked are subject to the law of Spain, and that the case should be heard in Spanish courts. The court's opinion was written by Judge Anthony Parrillo, who wrote that : \"In sum, we conclude that defendant has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that Spain is an available adequate forum to adjudicate the parties' dispute and therefore the motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds should have been denied without consideration of public- and private-interest factors.\" The decision reversed the ruling of the Superior Court and remanded the suit back to that court for trial. This is not the only asbestos-related lawsuit in which Owens-Illinois is cited as a defendant. The company is also a defendant (among other defendants) in asbestos cases filed in Ohio and other states. In an April 30 press release the company reported that asbestos-related payments had decreased slightly, stating: \"Asbestos-related cash payments during the first quarter of 2008 were $40.2 million, down slightly from $41.0 million during the first quarter of 2007.\" According to the press release  the company had 14,000 pending asbestos-related lawsuits as of March 31, 2008. In its balance sheet for the first quarter of 2008  the company reported US$835 million in asbestos-related liabilities. In a May 2 earnings call with financial analysts, Owens-Illinois Chief Financial Officer Edward C. White addressed asbestos-related expenses. \"Only a small portion of our first quarter asbestos payments related to the company's proactive legal strategy to reduce risk and accelerate asbestos resolution on favorable terms. Nevertheless, this strategy continues and additional expected spending is reflected both on the current liability portion of our balance sheet as well as in our full-year cash flow projection,\" said White. He went on to note that: \"We exited the business 50 years ago and have been dealing with the legal issues for almost 30 years. For OI, this remains a limited declining liability, which we will continue to manage in a conscientious and responsible manner.\" Asbestosis is a disease resulting from asbestos exposure which causes lung scarring and can lead to lung cancer. Exposure to asbestos can also lead to a more serious condition known as mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a cancer which develops in the sac surrounding the lungs and chest cavity, abdominal cavity, or the sac surrounding the heart. Patients with malignant mesothelioma generally do not have positive outcomes, and once diagnosed  have six months to a year to live.","domain":"news","before_edit":" Asbestos fibers The Spanish citizens worked aboard U.S. ships between 1950 and 1998, and claim  they were exposed to asbestos dust and fibers from piping insulation produced by Owens-Illinois.","after_edit":" Asbestos fibers The Spanish citizens worked aboard U.S. ships between 1950 and 1998, and claim that they were exposed to asbestos dust and fibers from piping insulation produced by Owens-Illinois.","start_sent_pos":530,"end_sent_pos":723,"raw_intents":["fluency","clarity","fluency"],"label":"fluency"}

Since Sony Computer Entertainment Taiwan Limited (SCE Taiwan) was established in December 2007, SCE Taiwan  participated in the 2007 Taipei IT Month to rearrange their styles from marketing and cross-industry cooperations. They finally decided to participate in the 2008 Taipei Game Show and to battle with Microsoft Taiwan by challenging different premiums and plans. On the other side of Microsoft Taiwan,  to gain popularity and notability at this show , they (Microsoft ) preliminary moved their new game launch from the 3C store to the TWTC again, since 2007. And also , they invited their spokespeople \"Mayday\" to get more visitors to visit the show. They won all of the categories of the popular presentation class. After a battle between the two main world-class companies, Microsoft & Sony not only showed different cultures from exhibition arrangements and product presentations but successfully marketed their indicative products in consuming and high-definition markets.

{"doc_id":25893514.0,"context":"When breast cancer is surgically excised, it can come back (local recurrence) in the remaining breast or on the chest wall in a small proportion of women. Adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary if breast cancer is treated by removing only the cancerous lump with a rim of surrounding normal tissue, as it reduces the chance of local recurrence significantly . When cancer does come back, it most commonly occurs in the tissues surrounding the original cancer (the tumour bed), even though there are multicentric cancers in remote areas of the breast. This suggests that it is most important to treat the tumour bed. The rationale for TARGIT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the tumour bed. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumour have been time tested and proven to be effective. EBRT is usually given as a course of whole breast radiotherapy and an additional tumour bed boost  . However, it has a few drawbacks; for example, the tumour bed where the boost dose should be applied can be missed (\"geographical miss\") due to the difficulties in localization of the complex wound cavity  even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay (\"temporal miss\") between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumour cells  . These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumour cells. Furthermore, TARGIT inhibits the stimulating effects of wound fluid on cancer cells, suggesting for the first time, a beneficial effect of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) on tumour microenvironment. In these studies, women treated with  TARGIT-IORT  during lumpectomy for breast cancer combined with whole breast radiotherapy had a significantly low mortality from non-breast-cancer causes, such as cardiovascular and lung complications, as well as other cancers compared with those who received whole breast radiotherapy. Therefore, this reduction was thought to be due to the delivery of TARGIT-IORT to the fresh tumour bed during the trauma of surgery rather than avoidance of scattered radiation from whole breast radiotherapy .","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Additionally, the usual delay (\"temporal miss\") between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumour cells  .","after_edit":" Additionally, the usual delay  between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumour cells  .","start_sent_pos":1225,"end_sent_pos":1373,"raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","coherence"],"label":"clarity"}

In 2008, Kosovo declared independence and has since been recognized by 98 countries. However, Serbia maintains that Kosovo continues to be its territory.

Clinton assigned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State ambassador Philip Reeker to support Ashton's efforts. Reeker and his team coordinated closely with EU colleagues and met with Serbian and Kosovar representatives on the margins of every dialogue session in Brussels, and during visits to the region. The result was the 15-point \"First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalisation of Relations\", initialed but not signed on 19 April 2013. After the agreement was concluded, the European Commission officially advised that work start on an SAA with Kosovo, and accession negotiations began with Serbia. The agreement was supported by the European Union, NATO, the OSCE, and the United Nations. In October 2013, arrangements were made for Serbian officials to visit North Kosovo.

{"doc_id":106849.0,"context":"A New Jersey state appeals court ruled Tuesday that fifteen Spanish citizens can sue over claims of health issues related to asbestos exposure while working aboard United States Navy and Coast Guard ships docked at United States-Spanish military installations. The defendant, Ohio-based company Owens Illinois, Inc., had sought a trial in a Spanish court, an opinion which was shared by the Superior Court which heard the case  . The three-judge panel appellate court overturned the decision of the Superior Court in a 3-0 ruling. Asbestos fibers The Spanish citizens worked aboard U.S. ships between 1950 and 1998, and claim  they were exposed to asbestos dust and fibers from piping insulation produced by Owens-Illinois. The piping insulation was originally manufactured in Sayreville, Middlesex County, and Berlin, Camden County  New Jersey. The workers say they suffer from diseases related to asbestos such as asbestosis. Owens-Illinois has headquarters in Toledo, Ohio and is a Delaware corporation. The New Jersey appellate panel ruled that the Superior Court judge did not consider where the plaintiffs wanted their case heard, and also held that the U.S. ships are considered U.S. territory and thus the workers' claimed health issues did not begin on Spanish land. Attorneys for Owens-Illinois argued that U.S. ships when docked are subject to the law of Spain, and that the case should be heard in Spanish courts. The court's opinion was written by Judge Anthony Parrillo, who wrote that : \"In sum, we conclude that defendant has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that Spain is an available adequate forum to adjudicate the parties' dispute and therefore the motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds should have been denied without consideration of public- and private-interest factors.\" The decision reversed the ruling of the Superior Court and remanded the suit back to that court for trial. This is not the only asbestos-related lawsuit in which Owens-Illinois is cited as a defendant. The company is also a defendant (among other defendants) in asbestos cases filed in Ohio and other states. In an April 30 press release the company reported that asbestos-related payments had decreased slightly, stating: \"Asbestos-related cash payments during the first quarter of 2008 were $40.2 million, down slightly from $41.0 million during the first quarter of 2007.\" According to the press release  the company had 14,000 pending asbestos-related lawsuits as of March 31, 2008. In its balance sheet for the first quarter of 2008  the company reported US$835 million in asbestos-related liabilities. In a May 2 earnings call with financial analysts, Owens-Illinois Chief Financial Officer Edward C. White addressed asbestos-related expenses. \"Only a small portion of our first quarter asbestos payments related to the company's proactive legal strategy to reduce risk and accelerate asbestos resolution on favorable terms. Nevertheless, this strategy continues and additional expected spending is reflected both on the current liability portion of our balance sheet as well as in our full-year cash flow projection,\" said White. He went on to note that: \"We exited the business 50 years ago and have been dealing with the legal issues for almost 30 years. For OI, this remains a limited declining liability, which we will continue to manage in a conscientious and responsible manner.\" Asbestosis is a disease resulting from asbestos exposure which causes lung scarring and can lead to lung cancer. Exposure to asbestos can also lead to a more serious condition known as mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a cancer which develops in the sac surrounding the lungs and chest cavity, abdominal cavity, or the sac surrounding the heart. Patients with malignant mesothelioma generally do not have positive outcomes, and once diagnosed  have six months to a year to live.","domain":"news","before_edit":" Attorneys for Owens-Illinois argued that U.S. ships when docked are subject to the law of Spain, and that the case should be heard in Spanish courts.","after_edit":" Attorneys for Owens-Illinois argued that U.S. ships , when docked, are subject to the law of Spain, and that the case should be heard in Spanish courts.","start_sent_pos":1275,"end_sent_pos":1425,"raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"],"label":"fluency"}

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered. On June 15th, the body of 45-year-old Joanne O'Rourke was found. Arrest Atkins was arrested on rape charges on August 21, 1992, after he was identified on a Detroit street by 34-year-old Darlene Saunders, who had been sodomized and raped by him in October 1991. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% He was questioned again, but categorically denied any involvement, claiming that he had no interest in women and was a homosexual. After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her. In several cases, he was unable to explain why he committed the murders: this was the case with Hardy, with whom Benjamin had an intimate relationship, but after doing drugs together, he said he strangled her for no apparent reason.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown.","after_edit":" On February 17th, the corpses of three girls were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown.","start_sent_pos":2603,"end_sent_pos":2840,"raw_intents":["style","meaning-changed","meaning-changed"],"label":"meaning-changed"}

{"doc_id":1602860.0,"context":"In the news In 2005, internet hunting became a major news story when a man in Texas set up a webcam and remotely controlled gun to allow hunters to shoot from their computers. According to the Humane Society, most internet hunts involve game ranches where animals are kept penned, making them essentially canned hunts.Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, Another less well-known incident occurred  two years prior to the Dick Cheney hunting incident when the vice president participated in a canned hunt at the Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania. Cheney and nine companions killed 417 out of 500 ringneck pheasants, of which the Vice President killed 70, and an unknown number of mallard ducks. In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country. South Africa environment minister announced long-awaited restrictions on lion hunting, declaring he was sickened by wealthy tourists shooting tame lions from the back of a truck and felling rhinos with a bow and arrow. This comes in response to the imbroglio created over the potential canned hunt of the African rhinoceros 'Baixinha.' Dismissing threats of legal action by the hunting industry, Marthinus Van Schalkwyk said the new law would ban \"canned\" hunting of big predators and rhinos in small enclosures that offer them no means of escape. In addition, lions bred in captivity would have to be released into the open for at least two years before they could be hunted. Van Schalkwyk said a previously proposed six-month delay would not give lions enough time to develop self-defence instincts. \"Hunting should be about fair chase ... testing the wits of a hunter against that of the animal,\" he told a press conference. \"Over the years that got eroded and now we are trying to re-establish that principle.\" This measure was later overturned. In May 2007 a much-reported hunting trip involved the killing of 1,051pound pet pig in an alleged canned hunt. The pig was named \"Monster Pig\" by the media and it was believed that the pig was a feral hog . It was soon discovered that the pig, previously named \"Fred , \"  had been someone's pet and was then sold to a hunting facility only a brief time before he was killed. On May 3, paying customers Mike Stone and his 11-year-old son , Jamison , hunted him in a fenced enclosure. Jamison shot Fred a total of eight times over a period of three hours. A June 2007 story on CNN detailed canned hunting in South Africa and includes a video of a canned lion hunt where the animal is shot against a fence. On November 30, 2014, CBS  60 Minutes broadcast a story (\"The Lion Whisperer\") about one man's sanctuary in South Africa for 26 lions, raised in captivity, who he rescued from the fate of canned lion hunting. In November 2015, the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa (PHASA) voted to disassociate itself from the practice of canned lion hunting in South Africa. Unless the conservation value of canned lion hunting is demonstrated to PHASA, URLanization will remain against the practice and, under penalty of expulsion, no PHASA members will be permitted to participate canned lion hunts. In November 2017  PHASA came under fire over the body's reversal of its 2015 policy against the hunting of captive-bred lions.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" It was soon discovered that the pig, previously named \"Fred , \"  had been someone's pet and was then sold to a hunting facility only a brief time before he was killed.","after_edit":" It was soon discovered that the pig, previously named \"Fred , \" , had been someone's pet and was then sold to a hunting facility only a brief time before he was killed.","start_sent_pos":2142,"end_sent_pos":2310,"raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"],"label":"fluency"}

{"doc_id":804964.0,"context":"Language Dehumanization and dehumanized perception can occur as a result of the language used to describe groups of people. Words such as migrant, immigrant, and expatriate are assigned to foreigners based on their social status and wealth, rather than ability, achievements, or political alignment. Expatriate is a word to describe the privileged, often light-skinned people newly residing in an area and has connotations that suggest ability, wealth, and trust. Meanwhile, the word immigrant is used to describe people coming to a new location to reside and infers a much less-desirable meaning. Further, \"immigrant\" is a word that can be paired with \"illegal\", which harbors a profoundly negative connotationto those projecting social cognition towards the other. The perpetual misuse of these words used to describe the other in the English language can alter the perception of a group in a derogatory way. \"Most of the time when we hear illegal immigrant%DIFDELCMD < ] %%% used, most of the time, the shorter version 'illegals' is being used as a noun, which implies that a human being is perpetually illegal. There is no other classification that I'm aware of where the individual is being rendered as unlawful as opposed to those individuals' actions.\" A series of language examinations found a direct relation between homophobic epithets and social cognitive distancing towards a group of homosexuals, a form of dehumanization. These epithets (e.g., faggot) were thought to function as dehumanizing labels because they tended to act as markers of deviance. One pair of studies found that subjects were more likely to associate malignant language with homosexuals, and that such language associations increased the physical distancing between the subject and the homosexual. This indicated that the malignant language could encourage dehumanization, cognitive and physical distancing in ways that other forms of malignant language do not.","domain":null,"before_edit":" Further, \"immigrant\" is a word that can be paired with \"illegal\", which harbors a profoundly negative connotationto those projecting social cognition towards the other.

To encourage the participation of the public, not only participants (exhibitors), but also URLanizers held lots of on-site events including the \"Taiwan Local Game Championship\", \"Gaming Adventure Area\", and several stage events during the show. With many gaming experts and visitors participating in the several events, the gaming population has progressively grown up . Especially in the \"Popular Game & Company Voting\" category, the public apparently looked at the gaming industry on the bright side as the OBMs (game production companies) produced many \"excellence\" products and marketed them around the world. Excellences from participants Microsoft vs. Sony, another platform battle Sony did a grand return by cooperating with government and academical units in Taiwan. Since Sony Computer Entertainment Taiwan Limited (SCE Taiwan) was established in December 2007, SCE Taiwan  participated in the 2007 Taipei IT Month to rearrange their styles from marketing and cross-industry cooperations. They finally decided to participate in the 2008 Taipei Game Show and to battle with Microsoft Taiwan by challenging different premiums and plans.
