All else being equal, words that tend to occur in more predictable environments are shorter than words that tend to occur in less predictable environments. One account of the informativity effect on duration is that the acoustic details of word reduction are stored as part of a word's  representation. Other research has argued that predictability effects are tied to prosodic structure in integral ways. With the aim of assessing a potential prosodic basis for informativity effects in speech production, this study extends past work in two directions; it investigated informativity effects in another large language, Mandarin Chinese, and broadened the study beyond word duration to additional acoustic dimensions, pitch and intensity, known to index prosodic prominence. The acoustic information of content words was extracted from a large telephone conversation speech corpus with over 400,000 tokens and 6,000 word types spoken by 1,655 individuals and analyzed for the effect of informativity using frequency statistics estimated from a 431 million word subtitle corpus. Results indicated that words with low informativity have shorter durations, replicating the effect found in English. In addition, informativity had significant effects on maximum pitch and intensity, two phonetic dimensions related to prosodic prominence. Extending this interpretation, these results suggest that informativity is closely linked to prosodic prominence, and that  lexical representation of a word includes phonetic details associated with its prosodic prominence .

However, there is still little knowledge about their capabilities and potential limitations for encoding and recovering word senses. In this article, we provide an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of the celebrated BERT model with respect to lexical ambiguity. One of the main conclusions of our analysis is that BERT captures high-level sense distinctions accurately , even when a limited number of examples is available for each word sense. Our analysis also reveals that in some cases language models come close to solving coarse-grained noun disambiguation under ideal conditions in terms of availability of training data and computing resources. However, this scenario rarely occurs in real-world settings and, hence, many practical challenges remain even in the coarse-grained setting. We also perform an in-depth comparison of the two main language model based WSD strategies, i.e., fine-tuning and feature extraction, finding that the latter approach is more robust with respect to sense bias and it can better exploit limited available training data.

Other research has argued that predictability effects are tied to prosodic structure in integral ways. With the aim of assessing a potential prosodic basis for informativity effects in speech production, this study extends past work in two directions; it investigated informativity effects in another large language, Mandarin Chinese, and broadened the study beyond word duration to additional acoustic dimensions, pitch and intensity, known to index prosodic prominence.

Results indicated that words with low informativity have shorter durations, replicating the effect found in English. In addition, informativity had significant effects on maximum pitch and intensity, two phonetic dimensions related to prosodic prominence. Extending this interpretation, these results suggest that informativity is closely linked to prosodic prominence, and that  lexical representation of a word includes phonetic details associated with its prosodic prominence .

The core belief behind current methodology, coined `the bitter lesson' by R.

We demonstrate that, through a learned strategy (or even simple heuristics), one can produce deceptively perturbed symbolic structures which maintain the downstream performance of the original structure while significantly deviating from the original semantics . In particular, we train a reinforcement learning policy to manipulate relation types or edge connections in a knowledge graph, such that the resulting downstream performance is maximally preserved. Across multiple models and tasks, our approach drastically alters knowledge graphs with little to no drop in performance.

Further , we propose a predictive approach dubbed Imagine-then-Arbitrate (ITA) to resolve this Wait-or-Answer task.

Bioinformatics provide vast gold-mines of structured and sequentially ordered text data leading to extraordinarily successful protein sequence LMs that promise new frontiers for generative and predictive tasks at low inference cost . Here, we addressed two questions: (1) To which extent can HPC up-scale protein LMs to larger databases and larger models? (2) To which extent can LMs extract features from single proteins to get closer to the performance of methods using evolutionary information? Methodology: Here, we trained two auto-regressive language models (Transformer-XL and XLNet) and two auto-encoder models ( BERT and Albert) using 80 billion amino acids from 200 million protein sequences (UniRef100) and 393 billion amino acids  from 2.1 billion protein sequences ( BFD ).

In this paper, we propose FILTER, an enhanced fusion method that takes cross-lingual data as input for XLM finetuning. Specifically, FILTER first encodes text input in the source language and its translation in the target language independently in the shallow layers, then performs cross-lingual fusion to extract multilingual knowledge in the intermediate layers, and finally performs further language-specific encoding. During inference, the model makes predictions based on the text input in the target language and its translation in the source language.

{"doc_id":2007.06225,"context":"Motivation: NLP continues improving substantially through auto-regressive and auto-encoding Language Models . These LMsrequire expensive computing resources for self-supervised or un-supervised learning from huge unlabelled text corpora. The information learned is transferred through so-called embeddings to downstream prediction tasks. Bioinformatics provide vast gold-mines of structured and sequentially ordered text data leading to extraordinarily successful protein sequence LMs that promise new frontiers for generative and predictive tasks at low inference cost . Here, we addressed two questions: (1) To which extent can HPC up-scale protein LMs to larger databases and larger models? (2) To which extent can LMs extract features from single proteins to get closer to the performance of methods using evolutionary information? Methodology: Here, we trained two auto-regressive language models (Transformer-XL and XLNet) and two auto-encoder models ( BERT and Albert) using 80 billion amino acids from 200 million protein sequences (UniRef100) and 393 billion amino acids  from 2.1 billion protein sequences ( BFD ). The LMs were trained on the Summit supercomputer , using 5616 GPUs  and one TPU Pod , using V3-512 cores. Results: The results of training these LMs on proteins was assessed by predicting secondary structure in three- and eight-states ( Q3= 75-83, Q8= 63-72), localization for 10 cellular compartments (Q10=74) and whether a protein is membrane-bound or water-soluble (Q2=89). Dimensionality reduction revealed that the LM-embeddings from unlabelled data (only protein sequences) captured important biophysical properties of the protein alphabet, namely the amino acids, and their well orchestrated interplay in governing the shapeof proteins. In the analogy of NLP, this implied having learned some of the grammar of the language of life realized in protein sequences.

{"doc_id":2103.06922,"context":"Recent studies indicate that NLU models are prone to rely on shortcut features for prediction, without achieving true language understanding. As a result, these models fail to generalize to real-world out-of-distribution data. In this work, we show that the words in the NLU training set can be modeled as a long-tailed distribution. There are two findings: 1) NLU models have strong preference for features located at the head of the long-tailed distribution, and 2) Shortcut features are picked up during very early few iterations of the model training. These two observations are further employed to formulate a measurement which can quantify the shortcut degree of each training sample. Based on this shortcut measurement, we propose a shortcut mitigation framework LGTR , to suppress the model from making overconfident predictions for samples with large shortcut degree. Experimental results on three NLU benchmarks demonstrate that our long-tailed distribution explanation accurately reflects the shortcut learning behavior of NLU models.

These LMsrequire expensive computing resources for self-supervised or un-supervised learning from huge unlabelled text corpora. The information learned is transferred through so-called embeddings to downstream prediction tasks. Bioinformatics provide vast gold-mines of structured and sequentially ordered text data leading to extraordinarily successful protein sequence LMs that promise new frontiers for generative and predictive tasks at low inference cost . Here, we addressed two questions: (1) To which extent can HPC up-scale protein LMs to larger databases and larger models? (2) To which extent can LMs extract features from single proteins to get closer to the performance of methods using evolutionary information? Methodology: Here, we trained two auto-regressive language models (Transformer-XL and XLNet) and two auto-encoder models ( BERT and Albert) using 80 billion amino acids from 200 million protein sequences (UniRef100) and 393 billion amino acids  from 2.1 billion protein sequences ( BFD ).

Results: The results of training these LMs on proteins was assessed by predicting secondary structure in three- and eight-states ( Q3= 75-83, Q8= 63-72), localization for 10 cellular compartments (Q10=74) and whether a protein is membrane-bound or water-soluble (Q2=89). Dimensionality reduction revealed that the LM-embeddings from unlabelled data (only protein sequences) captured important biophysical properties of the protein alphabet, namely the amino acids, and their well orchestrated interplay in governing the shapeof proteins.

These LMsrequire expensive computing resources for self-supervised or un-supervised learning from huge unlabelled text corpora. The information learned is transferred through so-called embeddings to downstream prediction tasks. Bioinformatics provide vast gold-mines of structured and sequentially ordered text data leading to extraordinarily successful protein sequence LMs that promise new frontiers for generative and predictive tasks at low inference cost . Here, we addressed two questions: (1) To which extent can HPC up-scale protein LMs to larger databases and larger models? (2) To which extent can LMs extract features from single proteins to get closer to the performance of methods using evolutionary information? Methodology: Here, we trained two auto-regressive language models (Transformer-XL and XLNet) and two auto-encoder models ( BERT and Albert) using 80 billion amino acids from 200 million protein sequences (UniRef100) and 393 billion amino acids  from 2.1 billion protein sequences ( BFD ).

In this paper, we propose FILTER, an enhanced fusion method that takes cross-lingual data as input for XLM finetuning. Specifically, FILTER first encodes text input in the source language and its translation in the target language independently in the shallow layers, then performs cross-lingual fusion to extract multilingual knowledge in the intermediate layers, and finally performs further language-specific encoding. During inference, the model makes predictions based on the text input in the target language and its translation in the source language.

Some people may tend to deliberate their full intents in several successive utterances, i. e., they use several consistent messages for readability instead of a long sentence to express their question. This creates a predicament faced by dialogue systems' application, especially in real-world industrial scenarios, in which the dialogue system is unsure that whether it should answer the user's query immediately or wait for users' further supplementary input. Motivated by such interesting quandary, we define a novel task: Wait-or-Answer to better tackle this dilemma faced by dialogue systems. We shed light on a new research topic about how the dialogue system can be more competent to behave in this Wait-or-Answer quandary. Further , we propose a predictive approach dubbed Imagine-then-Arbitrate (ITA) to resolve this Wait-or-Answer task. More specifically, we take advantage of an arbitrator model to help the dialogue system decide to wait or answer. The arbitrator's decision is made with the assistance of two ancillary imaginator models: a wait imaginator and an answer imaginator. The wait imaginator tries to predict what the user would supplement and use its prediction to persuade the arbitrator that the userhas some information to add, so the dialogue system should wait.

{"doc_id":108633.0,"context":"On Wednesday, a United States federal appeals court upheld convictions of fraud and obstruction of justice against media mogul Conrad Black, along with three other executives from his former press corporation  Hollinger International. Black, a Canadian-born who holds the title Baron Black of Crossharbour in the United Kingdom, was found guilty in July 2007 of three counts of wire and mail fraud for giving himself and others millions of dollars in illegal bonuses taken from Hollinger holdings, and for obstruction of justice based on surveillance footage of him moving 13 boxes of documents out of his Toronto office to his home the day after he was informed that he was being investigated. He was sentenced, and from March this year  began a 6 1\/ 2 year prison term. Peter Atkinson and John Boultbee were convicted on the same fraud charges, and were sentenced to terms of 24 and 27 months respectively, while Mark Kipnis, who was implicated in the fraud, was given probation with 6 months of home detention. The appeals panel from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, who heard the defence attorenys ' oral arguments, presented its opinion in a 16-page document in which they rejected arguments against both the fraud and obstruction charges. They noted that while the defence had presented a \"no harm-no foul argument\", in which they argued that they were owed the money appropriated, \"such arguments usually fare badly in criminal cases\". They also dismissed claims that instructions given to the jury by the judge had been incomplete, or unclear, stating that \"the defendants proposed a misleading statement as an alternative\", and that in such situations the judge is allowed to stay with the original instruction, and in particular is not required \"that a submitted charge be technically perfect to alert the court to the need for a particular charge\". The appeals judges also discounted arguments from the defence regarding whether the defendants were all aware of the illegality of the transactions, making reference to an \"ostrich argument\" ( based on the urban legend that ostriches sensing danger stick their heads in the sand ), in that choosing not to investigate the suspicious nature of the payments was equivalent to accepting their illegality. An argument from Black's defence regarding the obstruction charge, that in moving the documents he was not in fact escaping scrutiny, was similarly rejected, as \" All that needed to be proved is that the document was concealed in order to make it unavailable in an official proceeding,\" according to the ruling as written by Judge Richard Posner.","domain":"news","before_edit":" Black, a Canadian-born who holds the title Baron Black of Crossharbour in the United Kingdom, was found guilty in July 2007 of three counts of wire and mail fraud for giving himself and others millions of dollars in illegal bonuses taken from Hollinger holdings, and for obstruction of justice based on surveillance footage of him moving 13 boxes of documents out of his Toronto office to his home the day after he was informed that he was being investigated.","after_edit":" Black, born in Canada and bearer of the title Baron Black of Crossharbour in the United Kingdom, was found guilty in July 2007 of three counts of wire and mail fraud for giving himself and others millions of dollars in illegal bonuses taken from Hollinger holdings, and for obstruction of justice based on surveillance footage of him moving 13 boxes of documents out of his Toronto office to his home the day after he was informed that he was being investigated.","label":"clarity","raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"]}

The three-judge panel appellate court overturned the decision of the Superior Court in a 3-0 ruling. Asbestos fibers The Spanish citizens worked aboard U.S. ships between 1950 and 1998, and claim  they were exposed to asbestos dust and fibers from piping insulation produced by Owens-Illinois. The piping insulation was originally manufactured in Sayreville, Middlesex County, and Berlin, Camden County  New Jersey. The workers say they suffer from diseases related to asbestos such as asbestosis. Owens-Illinois has headquarters in Toledo, Ohio and is a Delaware corporation. The New Jersey appellate panel ruled that the Superior Court judge did not consider where the plaintiffs wanted their case heard, and also held that the U.S. ships are considered U.S. territory and thus the workers' claimed health issues did not begin on Spanish land. Attorneys for Owens-Illinois argued that U.S. ships when docked are subject to the law of Spain, and that the case should be heard in Spanish courts. The court's opinion was written by Judge Anthony Parrillo, who wrote that : \"In sum, we conclude that defendant has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that Spain is an available adequate forum to adjudicate the parties' dispute and therefore the motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds should have been denied without consideration of public- and private-interest factors.\" The decision reversed the ruling of the Superior Court and remanded the suit back to that court for trial. This is not the only asbestos-related lawsuit in which Owens-Illinois is cited as a defendant. The company is also a defendant (among other defendants) in asbestos cases filed in Ohio and other states. In an April 30 press release the company reported that asbestos-related payments had decreased slightly, stating: \"Asbestos-related cash payments during the first quarter of 2008 were $40.2 million, down slightly from $41.0 million during the first quarter of 2007.\" According to the press release  the company had 14,000 pending asbestos-related lawsuits as of March 31, 2008. In its balance sheet for the first quarter of 2008  the company reported US$835 million in asbestos-related liabilities. In a May 2 earnings call with financial analysts, Owens-Illinois Chief Financial Officer Edward C. White addressed asbestos-related expenses. \"Only a small portion of our first quarter asbestos payments related to the company's proactive legal strategy to reduce risk and accelerate asbestos resolution on favorable terms. Nevertheless, this strategy continues and additional expected spending is reflected both on the current liability portion of our balance sheet as well as in our full-year cash flow projection,\" said White. He went on to note that: \"We exited the business 50 years ago and have been dealing with the legal issues for almost 30 years. For OI, this remains a limited declining liability, which we will continue to manage in a conscientious and responsible manner.\" Asbestosis is a disease resulting from asbestos exposure which causes lung scarring and can lead to lung cancer. Exposure to asbestos can also lead to a more serious condition known as mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a cancer which develops in the sac surrounding the lungs and chest cavity, abdominal cavity, or the sac surrounding the heart. Patients with malignant mesothelioma generally do not have positive outcomes, and once diagnosed  have six months to a year to live.","domain":"news","before_edit":" Attorneys for Owens-Illinois argued that U.S. ships when docked are subject to the law of Spain, and that the case should be heard in Spanish courts.","after_edit":" Attorneys for Owens-Illinois argued that U.S. ships when docked are subject to the law of Spain, and so the case should be heard in Spanish courts.","label":"clarity","raw_intents":["clarity","coherence","fluency"]}

The officer said that most data about the hypothetical movements of the cloud (if the cloud exists) are made based on computer simulations they receive from Russian vendors, because no such simulation model is currently available in the Ukraine.

Johnson, 38, of Kingsford, Michigan was charged on Wednesday with killing three teenagers in a shooting on the Menominee River near Niagara, Wisconsin. Johnson was charged with first-degree intentional homicide. Authorities say he went to the popular bathing spot near the East Kingsford Railroad Bridge on July 31 and opened fire with a military-style rifle, killing three and injuring one. The Associated Press reports that he faces life in prison without parole if convicted . Wisconsin does not have the death penalty. However, as one of the bodies was found on the Michigan side of the border, he could potentially face charges there, or perhaps even in federal court. He is being represented by a public defender, Len Kachinsky. Local teens said Johnson often was seen at the site, but mostly kept to himself. On July 31, the Associated Press reports  he emerged from the woods wearing camouflage clothing and opened fire without saying a word. Johnson fled and surrendered the next day after a multi-agency manhunt. Johnson had been accused of a sexual assault, and his mother speculated he may have panicked after hearing police wanted to speak with him. The Detroit Free Press reports that  in a confession to police, Johnson said the shooting was set in motion when Johnson lured the woman to the bridge the day before and sexually assaulted her. Worried that he would be arrested, Johnson returned to the woods, planning to ambush law enforcement officers coming to find him. After he spent a night in the woods and no officers came, he returned home at 10 a.m.  on July 31, asked his mother if police had been looking for him, then left at 3:00 p.m. He says he then got his weapons and returned to the woods.

The Associated Press reports that he faces life in prison without parole if convicted . Wisconsin does not have the death penalty.

Johnson fled and surrendered the next day after a multi-agency manhunt. Johnson had been accused of a sexual assault, and his mother speculated he may have panicked after hearing police wanted to speak with him.

The officer said that most data about the hypothetical movements of the cloud (if the cloud exists) are made based on computer simulations they receive from Russian vendors, because no such simulation model is currently available in the Ukraine. The closest available on spot measures are related to areas located several kilometers away from the epicentre. Removal operation In the same press release  the Mayor of Kiev also announced that no transport of whatever dangerous material will be allowed in the town area. The removal by railway of the phosphor containers involved in the accident was originally planned for today.

The propaganda campaign, which specifically targets 14 to 19 year-olds aims to reduce the number of young people experimenting with the soft drug.

The propaganda , which NSW Health has cost at AUD$600,000 , that could of been spent on feeding starving children, will use a variety of print ads placed at bus stops and in youth magazines in addition to propaganda messages on websites such as MySpace and MSN. Propaganda ads use a tag line saying \"Pot. It mightn't kill you, but it could turn politicians into dickheads \". The propaganda images show a person staring from a black and white photo with quotes like \"You've got great eyes, dialated eyes are hot \" and \"I'd lend you money, but the government would just spend it on these ads \" , as part of an emotional appeal to manipulate the reader into an unfair bias on the topic, instead of comparing facts and science to the message they are promoting . The director of drug and alcohol programs with NSW Health, David McGrath said many young people know that cannabis was safe and its use was normal. \"There is still a significant cohort of people who think, particularly with the young person's age group, that cannabis is normal,\" Mr McGrath said. Mr McGrath said despite the number of young cannabis users had halved from forty percent to twenty percent, but claimed more needed to be done. \"We want to prevent people who are thinking about taking cannabis up from taking it up and also encouraging those people that are using cannabis to cease, through use of unrelenting lies and social shunning \" he said. Mr McGrath said young people had to be warned about the possible consequences of smoking cannabis, such as the alleged link with comedians and how it may improve social interaction and physical health. NSW Health Minister, Reba Meagher said a recent study indicated that while cannabis use among young people is in decline, almost one third of teenagers have tried cannabis.

Source: Caltrans The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating allegations of wrongdoing in the building of the new $ 1.5 billion \"skyway\" portion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge spanning the San Francisco Bay between Oakland and Yerba Buena Island , according to a report first published in the Oakland Tribune. According to reports, no criminal charges have been filed. The paper reported that welders for KFM, the company under contract to build the bridge, told authorities that they were pressured and even paid monthly bonuses of between $200 and $600 for performing substandard welds on the support piers for the bridge if it meant the project proceeded faster. But Caltrans, the state agency in charge of building the bridge said their inspectors checked the welds and determined that the work, although rushed, met safety standards. According to a report by Oakland television station, KTVU, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Transportation are joining the FBI in the investigation of the matter. The federal government is getting involved in the investigation because more than $1 million in U.S. taxpayer money was already spent during construction. If faulty welds are found in the support piers, according to reports, much of the new construction may have to be torn down to be rebuilt. The current 68-year-old span was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. At $ 6.2 billion total, the new bridge qualifies as the largest public works project in California's history.","domain":"news","before_edit":" The paper reported that welders for KFM, the company under contract to build the bridge, told authorities that they were pressured and even paid monthly bonuses of between $200 and $600 for performing substandard welds on the support piers for the bridge if it meant the project proceeded faster.","after_edit":" The paper reported that welders for KFM, the company under contract to build the bridge, told authorities  they were pressured and even paid monthly bonuses of between $200 and $600 for performing substandard welds on the support piers for the bridge if it meant the project proceeded faster.","label":"coherence","raw_intents":["coherence","coherence","fluency"]}

The service will be provided by the Kiev administration. In an interview to TV channel UT-1  an officer of the ecological service admitted that they have no real data about the area closer to the accident, because not even government officers are permitted to reach it. The officer said that most data about the hypothetical movements of the cloud (if the cloud exists) are made based on computer simulations they receive from Russian vendors, because no such simulation model is currently available in the Ukraine. The closest available on spot measures are related to areas located several kilometers away from the epicentre. Removal operation In the same press release  the Mayor of Kiev also announced that no transport of whatever dangerous material will be allowed in the town area. The removal by railway of the phosphor containers involved in the accident was originally planned for today. Its unclear how Kievs transit refusal may affect the operationand whether the mayor has the authority to block national traffic on the railways. According to the Press Manager of the Ministery for Emergency Situations, Mr. Igor Krol', four containers will be lifted and put back on the rails today. Five containers have already been lifted. Yet the weather may affect the operations, as violent storms and very strong winds are expected in the area. This is going to introduce a serious risk factor for the phosphor that still remains on the ground. The contaminating products are in fact insulated from the air by means of pillows made of air and foam; a strong wind may cause new emergencies by even just partially removing such insulation structures.

Asbestos fibers The Spanish citizens worked aboard U.S. ships between 1950 and 1998, and claim  they were exposed to asbestos dust and fibers from piping insulation produced by Owens-Illinois. The piping insulation was originally manufactured in Sayreville, Middlesex County, and Berlin, Camden County  New Jersey. The workers say they suffer from diseases related to asbestos such as asbestosis. Owens-Illinois has headquarters in Toledo, Ohio and is a Delaware corporation. The New Jersey appellate panel ruled that the Superior Court judge did not consider where the plaintiffs wanted their case heard, and also held that the U.S. ships are considered U.S. territory and thus the workers' claimed health issues did not begin on Spanish land. Attorneys for Owens-Illinois argued that U.S. ships when docked are subject to the law of Spain, and that the case should be heard in Spanish courts. The court's opinion was written by Judge Anthony Parrillo, who wrote that : \"In sum, we conclude that defendant has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that Spain is an available adequate forum to adjudicate the parties' dispute and therefore the motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds should have been denied without consideration of public- and private-interest factors.\" The decision reversed the ruling of the Superior Court and remanded the suit back to that court for trial. This is not the only asbestos-related lawsuit in which Owens-Illinois is cited as a defendant. The company is also a defendant (among other defendants) in asbestos cases filed in Ohio and other states. In an April 30 press release the company reported that asbestos-related payments had decreased slightly, stating: \"Asbestos-related cash payments during the first quarter of 2008 were $40.2 million, down slightly from $41.0 million during the first quarter of 2007.\" According to the press release  the company had 14,000 pending asbestos-related lawsuits as of March 31, 2008. In its balance sheet for the first quarter of 2008  the company reported US$835 million in asbestos-related liabilities. In a May 2 earnings call with financial analysts, Owens-Illinois Chief Financial Officer Edward C. White addressed asbestos-related expenses. \"Only a small portion of our first quarter asbestos payments related to the company's proactive legal strategy to reduce risk and accelerate asbestos resolution on favorable terms. Nevertheless, this strategy continues and additional expected spending is reflected both on the current liability portion of our balance sheet as well as in our full-year cash flow projection,\" said White. He went on to note that: \"We exited the business 50 years ago and have been dealing with the legal issues for almost 30 years. For OI, this remains a limited declining liability, which we will continue to manage in a conscientious and responsible manner.\" Asbestosis is a disease resulting from asbestos exposure which causes lung scarring and can lead to lung cancer. Exposure to asbestos can also lead to a more serious condition known as mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is a cancer which develops in the sac surrounding the lungs and chest cavity, abdominal cavity, or the sac surrounding the heart. Patients with malignant mesothelioma generally do not have positive outcomes, and once diagnosed  have six months to a year to live.","domain":"news","before_edit":" The court's opinion was written by Judge Anthony Parrillo, who wrote that : \"In sum, we conclude that defendant has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that Spain is an available adequate forum to adjudicate the parties' dispute and therefore the motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds should have been denied without consideration of public- and private-interest factors.\"","after_edit":" The court's opinion , written by Judge Anthony Parrillo, who wrote that : \"In sum, we conclude that defendant has failed to carry its burden to demonstrate that Spain is an available adequate forum to adjudicate the parties' dispute and therefore the motion to dismiss on forum non conveniens grounds should have been denied without consideration of public- and private-interest factors.\"","label":"coherence","raw_intents":["coherence","coherence","fluency"]}

According to reports, no criminal charges have been filed. The paper reported that welders for KFM, the company under contract to build the bridge, told authorities that they were pressured and even paid monthly bonuses of between $200 and $600 for performing substandard welds on the support piers for the bridge if it meant the project proceeded faster. But Caltrans, the state agency in charge of building the bridge said their inspectors checked the welds and determined that the work, although rushed, met safety standards. According to a report by Oakland television station, KTVU, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Transportation are joining the FBI in the investigation of the matter. The federal government is getting involved in the investigation because more than $1 million in U.S. taxpayer money was already spent during construction.

The propaganda campaign, which specifically targets 14 to 19 year-olds aims to reduce the number of young people experimenting with the soft drug. The advertisements are the result of a tightening of cannabis laws in NSW last year. The propaganda , which NSW Health has cost at AUD$600,000 , that could of been spent on feeding starving children, will use a variety of print ads placed at bus stops and in youth magazines in addition to propaganda messages on websites such as MySpace and MSN. Propaganda ads use a tag line saying \"Pot. It mightn't kill you, but it could turn politicians into dickheads \". The propaganda images show a person staring from a black and white photo with quotes like \"You've got great eyes, dialated eyes are hot \" and \"I'd lend you money, but the government would just spend it on these ads \" , as part of an emotional appeal to manipulate the reader into an unfair bias on the topic, instead of comparing facts and science to the message they are promoting . The director of drug and alcohol programs with NSW Health, David McGrath said many young people know that cannabis was safe and its use was normal. \"There is still a significant cohort of people who think, particularly with the young person's age group, that cannabis is normal,\" Mr McGrath said. Mr McGrath said despite the number of young cannabis users had halved from forty percent to twenty percent, but claimed more needed to be done. \"We want to prevent people who are thinking about taking cannabis up from taking it up and also encouraging those people that are using cannabis to cease, through use of unrelenting lies and social shunning \" he said. Mr McGrath said young people had to be warned about the possible consequences of smoking cannabis, such as the alleged link with comedians and how it may improve social interaction and physical health. NSW Health Minister, Reba Meagher said a recent study indicated that while cannabis use among young people is in decline, almost one third of teenagers have tried cannabis.

The paper reported that welders for KFM, the company under contract to build the bridge, told authorities that they were pressured and even paid monthly bonuses of between $200 and $600 for performing substandard welds on the support piers for the bridge if it meant the project proceeded faster. But Caltrans, the state agency in charge of building the bridge said their inspectors checked the welds and determined that the work, although rushed, met safety standards. According to a report by Oakland television station, KTVU, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Transportation are joining the FBI in the investigation of the matter. The federal government is getting involved in the investigation because more than $1 million in U.S. taxpayer money was already spent during construction.

The current 68-year-old span was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

The Associated Press reports a second related death from a traffic accident. 30 mobile homes have been destroyed.

The propaganda campaign, which specifically targets 14 to 19 year-olds aims to reduce the number of young people experimenting with the soft drug. The advertisements are the result of a tightening of cannabis laws in NSW last year. The propaganda , which NSW Health has cost at AUD$600,000 , that could of been spent on feeding starving children, will use a variety of print ads placed at bus stops and in youth magazines in addition to propaganda messages on websites such as MySpace and MSN. Propaganda ads use a tag line saying \"Pot. It mightn't kill you, but it could turn politicians into dickheads \". The propaganda images show a person staring from a black and white photo with quotes like \"You've got great eyes, dialated eyes are hot \" and \"I'd lend you money, but the government would just spend it on these ads \" , as part of an emotional appeal to manipulate the reader into an unfair bias on the topic, instead of comparing facts and science to the message they are promoting . The director of drug and alcohol programs with NSW Health, David McGrath said many young people know that cannabis was safe and its use was normal. \"There is still a significant cohort of people who think, particularly with the young person's age group, that cannabis is normal,\" Mr McGrath said. Mr McGrath said despite the number of young cannabis users had halved from forty percent to twenty percent, but claimed more needed to be done. \"We want to prevent people who are thinking about taking cannabis up from taking it up and also encouraging those people that are using cannabis to cease, through use of unrelenting lies and social shunning \" he said. Mr McGrath said young people had to be warned about the possible consequences of smoking cannabis, such as the alleged link with comedians and how it may improve social interaction and physical health. NSW Health Minister, Reba Meagher said a recent study indicated that while cannabis use among young people is in decline, almost one third of teenagers have tried cannabis. She also claimed that cannabis remained common within the community. \"Cannabis is a drug that is readily available in our community and it does not come with serious risk,\" she said.","domain":"news","before_edit":" The propaganda images show a person staring from a black and white photo with quotes like \"You've got great eyes, dialated eyes are hot \" and \"I'd lend you money, but the government would just spend it on these ads \" , as part of an emotional appeal to manipulate the reader into an unfair bias on the topic, instead of comparing facts and science to the message they are promoting .","after_edit":" The propaganda images show a person staring from a black and white photo with quotes like \"You've got great eyes, when they're not bloodshot \" and \"I'd lend you money, but the government would just spend it on these ads \" , as part of an emotional appeal to manipulate the reader into an unfair bias on the topic, instead of comparing facts and science to the message they are promoting .","label":"meaning-changed","raw_intents":["clarity","meaning-changed","meaning-changed"]}

Apparently, Level 3 recently demanded that its peers (other ISPs that connect to them on a mutually beneficial level) pay Level 3 $ 30.000 USD. Some speculate that their quarterly report released yesterday and subsequent stock price dropping caused them to make a display of power in order to convince other ISPs to pay up.

Authorities say he went to the popular bathing spot near the East Kingsford Railroad Bridge on July 31 and opened fire with a military-style rifle, killing three and injuring one. The Associated Press reports that he faces life in prison without parole if convicted . Wisconsin does not have the death penalty. However, as one of the bodies was found on the Michigan side of the border, he could potentially face charges there, or perhaps even in federal court.

On July 31, the Associated Press reports  he emerged from the woods wearing camouflage clothing and opened fire without saying a word. Johnson fled and surrendered the next day after a multi-agency manhunt. Johnson had been accused of a sexual assault, and his mother speculated he may have panicked after hearing police wanted to speak with him.

Source: Caltrans The Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating allegations of wrongdoing in the building of the new $ 1.5 billion \"skyway\" portion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge spanning the San Francisco Bay between Oakland and Yerba Buena Island , according to a report first published in the Oakland Tribune. According to reports, no criminal charges have been filed. The paper reported that welders for KFM, the company under contract to build the bridge, told authorities that they were pressured and even paid monthly bonuses of between $200 and $600 for performing substandard welds on the support piers for the bridge if it meant the project proceeded faster. But Caltrans, the state agency in charge of building the bridge said their inspectors checked the welds and determined that the work, although rushed, met safety standards. According to a report by Oakland television station, KTVU, the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Labor and the U.S. Department of Transportation are joining the FBI in the investigation of the matter. The federal government is getting involved in the investigation because more than $1 million in U.S. taxpayer money was already spent during construction. If faulty welds are found in the support piers, according to reports, much of the new construction may have to be torn down to be rebuilt. The current 68-year-old span was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

The Antipiratbyrn previously gained notoriety by paying an infiltrator to plant copyrighted material on the Swedish ISP Bahnhof's servers.

{"doc_id":55503854.0,"context":"Relation to traditional epistemology Traditional epistemology and Bayesian epistemology are both forms of epistemology, but they differ in various respects, for example, concerning their methodology, their interpretation of belief , the role justification or confirmation plays in them and some of their research interests. Traditional epistemology focuses on topics such as the analysis of the nature of knowledge, usually in terms of justified true beliefs , the sources of knowledge , like perception or testimony, the structure of a body of knowledge, for example in the form of foundationalismor coherentism, and the problem of philosophical skepticism or the question of whether knowledge is possible at all . These inquiries are usually based on epistemic intuitions and regard beliefs as either present or absent . Bayesian epistemology, on the other hand, works by formalizing concepts and problems, which are often vague in the traditional approach. It thereby focuses more on mathematical intuitions and promises a higher degree of precision. It sees belief as a continuous phenomenon that comes in various degrees, so-called credences. Some Bayesians have even suggested that the regular notion of belief should be abandoned. But there are also proposals to connect the two, for example, the Lockean thesis, which defines belief as credence above a certain threshold. Justification plays a central role in traditional epistemology while Bayesians have focused on the related notions of confirmation and disconfirmation through evidence. The notion of evidence is important for both approaches but only the traditional approach has been interested in studying the sources of evidence, like perception and memory.

It is alleged by the Pakistani government that he was arrested in the Pakistani province of Balochistan on charges of terrorism and spying for India's  Research and Analysis Wing. On 10 April 2017, India's Ministry of External Affairs stated that he had been \"kidnapped last year from Iran and his subsequent presence in Pakistan has never been explained credibly\". The Pakistani government claimed that he was a commander in the Indian Navy who was involved in subversive activities inside Pakistan and was arrested on 3 March 2016 during a counter-intelligence operation in Balochistan. The Indian government recognised Jadhav as a former naval officer but denied any current links with him and maintained that he took premature retirement and operated a business in Iranian city of Chabahar and was abducted from there .Revealed: 'Spy' Kulbhushan Yadav not caught but abducted by extremist Sunni group Jaishul Adil , India Today, 30 March 2016. Pakistani security forces reported Jadhav as a serving officer in the Indian Navy and stated that he was commissioned to the Research and Analysis Wing  , India's external intelligence agency. They believed him to be involved in subversive activities in Balochistan and Karachi. Jadhav was soon shifted to Islamabad for interrogation. While according to Indian sources, Jadhav was kidnapped by Mullah Shahozi of Jaish ul-Adl from Chabahar and was transported via Sarbaz to IranPakistan border and where he handed Jadhav over to the Pakistani Army. In a statement issued in the Parliament of India on 11 April 2017, Rajnath Singh, India's Minister of Home Affairs, reiterated that Jadhav was kidnapped by Pakistani agencies from Iran and put through trial as a R AW agent. Sushma Swaraj, India's Minister of External Affairs said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Jadhav and termed his sentencing an act of \"premeditated murder\". Swaraj said that if Pakistan implemented the death sentence, the bilateral relations between both countries would face dire consequences. The ICJ proceedings began in The Hague on 15 May to review the case. India and Pakistan both sent their legal teams to put forward their arguments, led by Harish Salve and Khawar Qureshi QC respectively. On 18 May 2017, the International Court of Justice stayed the hanging of Jadhav by Pakistan . On 22 June 2017, Pakistani sources confirmed that Jadhav had sought clemency from the country's army chief following his conviction. Pakistan also released a new confessional video of Jadhav, in which he stated that he visited Karachi twice for gathering intelligence on naval facilities. He also admitted to supporting and funding, on behalf of R AW , Baloch militants affiliated with the BLA and BRA, in addition to infiltrating and establishing \"30 to 40 R AW operatives along the Makran Coast\" for involvement in terrorist activities. Jadhav said that R AW 's activities in Balochistan and Sindh were conducted under the direction of Anil Kumar Dhasmana. India's Foreign Ministry again dismissed the confession as \"false propaganda\", stating that Pakistan was trying to influence ICJ proceedings while denying the consular rights to Jadhav. ICJ did not allow Pakistan to play the video during the hearing. On 17 July 2019, the ICJ, in its verdict, rejected India's appeal for Jadhav's release and directed Pakistan to allow consular access and effectively Stayed the death sentence. The court ordered that Pakistan should grant consular access to Jhadav. Pakistan and India both claimed victory and welcomed the judgement of ICJ.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" On 10 April 2017, India's Ministry of External Affairs stated that he had been \"kidnapped last year from Iran and his subsequent presence in Pakistan has never been explained credibly\".","after_edit":" On 10 April 2017, Indian foreign ministry alleged he had been \"kidnapped last year from Iran and his subsequent presence in Pakistan has never been explained credibly\".","label":"clarity","raw_intents":["style","clarity","clarity"]}
{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification;","after_edit":" These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people using a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification;","label":"clarity","raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","clarity"]}

Adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary if breast cancer is treated by removing only the cancerous lump with a rim of surrounding normal tissue, as it reduces the chance of local recurrence significantly . When cancer does come back, it most commonly occurs in the tissues surrounding the original cancer (the tumour bed), even though there are multicentric cancers in remote areas of the breast. This suggests that it is most important to treat the tumour bed. The rationale for TARGIT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the tumour bed. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumour have been time tested and proven to be effective. EBRT is usually given as a course of whole breast radiotherapy and an additional tumour bed boost  . However, it has a few drawbacks; for example, the tumour bed where the boost dose should be applied can be missed (\"geographical miss\") due to the difficulties in localization of the complex wound cavity  even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay (\"temporal miss\") between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumour cells  . These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumour cells. Furthermore, TARGIT inhibits the stimulating effects of wound fluid on cancer cells, suggesting for the first time, a beneficial effect of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) on tumour microenvironment. In these studies, women treated with  TARGIT-IORT  during lumpectomy for breast cancer combined with whole breast radiotherapy had a significantly low mortality from non-breast-cancer causes, such as cardiovascular and lung complications, as well as other cancers compared with those who received whole breast radiotherapy. Therefore, this reduction was thought to be due to the delivery of TARGIT-IORT to the fresh tumour bed during the trauma of surgery rather than avoidance of scattered radiation from whole breast radiotherapy .","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Additionally, the usual delay (\"temporal miss\") between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumour cells  .","after_edit":" Additionally, the usual delay  between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumour cells  .","label":"clarity","raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","coherence"]}

The agreement was negotiated and concluded in Brussels under the auspices of the European Union and signed on 19 April 2013. Negotiations were led by Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Da\u010di\u0107 and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Tha\u00e7i and mediated by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton. The government of Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as a sovereign state, but began normalizing relations with the government of Kosovo nonetheless, in accordance with the Brussels URL In 2018, Serbia's president Aleksandar Vucic commented that the agreement is a difficult compromise for Serbia, which according to him fulfilled all of its obligations. Background Following the Kosovo War and NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Kosovo, as part of Serbia and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was placed under United Nations administration under UNSC Resolution 1244. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence and has since been recognized by 98 countries. However, Serbia maintains that Kosovo continues to be its territory. Kosovo has become a member of several international organizations, while according to Serbia and about half of the UN member states, Resolution 1244 remains legally binding on all parties.

Baroness Ashton, the EU High Representative, had been chairing talks for two years, followed by Federica Mogherini. Normalization of relations with neighboring states is a key precondition for states wishing to join the EU; the Brussels Agreement brought Serbia close to EU accession talks and Kosovo to initialing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). The SAA was signed by HR Mogherini and PM Mustafa in October 2015. Removing the parallel Serbian structures in the Northern part of Kosovo remains challenging. 330px|Ivica Da\u010di\u0107, Prime Minister of Serbia (left), Catherine Ashton (middle), and Hashim Tha\u00e7i, Prime Minister of Kosovo (right) in Munich, 2014. United States diplomats have supported the EU-led dialogue from the beginning. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton invited Baroness Ashton to undertake joint travel in the Balkans, and the two made joint visits to Belgrade and Pristina (as well as Sarajevo) in October 2012. Clinton assigned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State ambassador Philip Reeker to support Ashton's efforts. Reeker and his team coordinated closely with EU colleagues and met with Serbian and Kosovar representatives on the margins of every dialogue session in Brussels, and during visits to the region. The result was the 15-point \"First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalisation of Relations\", initialed but not signed on 19 April 2013. After the agreement was concluded, the European Commission officially advised that work start on an SAA with Kosovo, and accession negotiations began with Serbia.

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered.

After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her. In several cases, he was unable to explain why he committed the murders: this was the case with Hardy, with whom Benjamin had an intimate relationship, but after doing drugs together, he said he strangled her for no apparent reason.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier .

From the 1920s through the 1940s rammed-earth construction in the US was studied. South Dakota State College extensively researched and constructed almost one hundred weathering walls of rammed earth. For over 30 years the college investigated the use of paints and plasters in relation to colloids in soil. In 1945, Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina published the results of their research of rammed earth in a pamphlet titled \"Rammed Earth Building Construction\". In 1936, on a homestead near Gardendale, Alabama, the United States Department of Agriculture constructed an experimental community of rammed-earth edifices with architect Thomas Hibben. The houses were inexpensively constructed and were sold to the public along with sufficient land for gardens and small plots for livestock. The project successfully provided valuable homes to low-income families. The US Agency for International Development is working with undeveloped countries to improve the engineering of rammed-earth houses.

{"doc_id":51488038.0,"context":"The vulture and the little girl, also known as \"The Struggling Girl\", is a famous photograph by Kevin Carter which first appeared in The New York Times on 26 March 1993. It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a hooded vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan (now South Sudan), in March 1993, and to have survived the incident. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. Carter took his own life four months after winning the prize. Background The Hunger Triangle, a name URLanisations used in the 1990s for the area defined by the southern Sudan communities Kongor, Ayod, and Waat, was dependent on UNESCO and other URLanisations to fight famine. Forty percent of the area's children under 5 years old were malnourished as of January 1993, and an estimated 10 to 13 adults died of starvation daily in Ayod alone. To raise awareness of the situation, Operation Lifeline Sudan invited photojournalists and others, previously excluded from entering the country, to report on conditions. In March 1993, the government began granting visas to journalists for a 24-hour stay with severe restrictions on their travel within the country, including government supervision at all times. Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan. It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva saw this as a chance to work more as a war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested in going. According to fellow war photographer Greg Marinovich, Carter saw the trip as an opportunity to fix some problems \"he felt trapped in\". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\". To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have \"great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan pancake\", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: \"The UN hoped to publish the famine Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for URLanisations to sustain funding\". About the political differences and fighting \"Joo and Kevin knew none of this they just wanted to get in and shoot pictures\". Waiting in Nairobi Silva and Carter had prepared carefully for the trip. They stopped in Nairobi on their way to Sudan. The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region . But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod. In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards. The residents of the hamlet have been looked after by the UN aid station for some time. Greg Marinovich and Joo Silva described that in the book The Bang Bang Club, Chapter 10 \"Flies and Hungry People\". The child was already cared for before Kevin Carter and Joo Silva landed there and Carter took his famous picture. Marinovich wrote that the villagers were already waiting next to the runway to get the food as quickly as possible: \"Mothers who had joined the throng waiting for food left their children on the sandy ground nearby.\" Silva and Carter separated to take pictures of both children and adults, both the living and dead, all victims of the catastrophic famine that had arisen through the war. Carter went several times to Silva to tell him about the shocking situation he had just photographed. Witnessing the famine affected him emotionally. Silva was searching for rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority and when he found some soldiers Carter joined him. The soldiers did not speak English, but one was interested in Carter's watch. Carter gave him his cheap wristwatch as a gift. The soldiers became their bodyguards and followed them for their protection. To stay a week with the rebels they needed the permission of a rebel commander. Their plane was due to depart in an hour and without the permission to stay they would be forced to fly out. Again they separated and Silva went to the clinic complex to ask for the rebel commander and he was told the commander was in Kongor, South Sudan. This was good news for Silva, as \"their little UN plane was heading there next\". He left the clinic and went back to the runway, taking pictures of children and adults on his way. He came across a child lying on his face in the hot sun he took a picture. In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of \"fevers\", according to his family.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan.","after_edit":" Silva and Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan.","label":"clarity","raw_intents":["coherence","clarity","clarity"]}

{"doc_id":6970425.0,"context":"Lateral succession Lateral or fraternal system of succession mandates principles of seniority among members of a dynasty or dynastic clan, with a purpose of election a best qualified candidate for the leadership. The leaders are elected as being the most mature elders of the clan, already in possession of military power and competence. Fraternal succession is preferred to ensure that mature leaders are in charge, removing a need for regents. The lateral system of succession may or may not exclude male descendants in the female line from succession. In practice, when no male heir is mature enough, a female heir is usually determined \"pragmatically\", by proximity to the last monarch, like Boariks of the Caucasian Huns or Tamiris of Massagetes in Middle Asia  . The lateral monarch is generally elected after the leadership throne becomes vacant. In the early years of the Mongol empire, the death of the ruling monarchs, Genghis Khan and gedei Khan, immediately stopped the Mongol western campaigns because of the upcoming elections. A drawback of the lateral succession is that, while ensuring a most competent leadership for the moment, the system inherently created derelict prince lines not eligible for succession. Any scion of an eligible heir that did not live long enough to ascend to the throne was cast aside as not eligible, creating a pool of discontented pretenders called Tegin in Turkic and Izgoi in Rus dynastic lines. The unsettled pool of derelict princes would eventually bring havoc to the succession order and dismemberment to the state.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In practice, when no male heir is mature enough, a female heir is usually determined \"pragmatically\", by proximity to the last monarch, like Boariks of the Caucasian Huns or Tamiris of Massagetes in Middle Asia  .","after_edit":" In practice, when no male heir is mature enough, a female heir is usually determined \"pragmatically\", by proximity to the last monarch, like Boariks of the Caucasian Huns or Tamiris of Massagetes in Middle Asia were selected .","label":"clarity","raw_intents":["style","clarity","clarity"]}

The technique was designed in 1998 at the University College London. In patients having lumpectomy for breast cancer, the TARGIT-A(lone) randomized controlled trial (recruitment from 20002012) tested whether TARGIT within a risk-adapted approach is non-inferior to conventional course of external beam postoperative radiotherapy given over several weeks. TARGIT is a method where the radiation is applied during an operation and targeted to the peri-tumoural tissues. TARGIT technique was designed at University College London by Jayant S Vaidya (who coined the TARGIT acronym) and Michael Baum along with Jeffrey S Tobias in 1998. The term was first used when the technique was described, and the protocol for a randomised trial was published by The Lancet. Technique TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy (TARGIT) IORT for breast cancer The machine used for TARGIT is Intrabeam (Carl Zeiss , Germany) . It is a miniature and mobile X-ray source which emits low energy X-ray radiation (max. 50 kV) in isotropic distribution. Due to the higher ionization density caused by soft X-ray radiation in the tissue, the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) of low-energy X-rays on tumour cells is higher when compared to high-energy X-rays or gamma rays which are delivered by linear accelerators. The radiation which is produced by mobile radiation systems has a limited range . For this reason, conventional walls are regarded sufficient to stop the radiation scatter produced in the operating room and no extra measures for radiation protection are necessary. This makes IORT for breast cancer by the TARGIT technique available in most operating rooms. The surgical technique is relatively simple but needs to be meticulously followed .","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"Targeted intra-operative radiotherapy, also known as targeted IORT or TARGIT (TARGeted Intraoperative radioTherapy) is a technique of giving radiotherapy to the tissues surrounding a cancer after its surgical removal, a form of intraoperative radiation therapy.","after_edit":"Targeted intra-operative radiotherapy, also known as targeted IORT  is a technique of giving radiotherapy to the tissues surrounding a cancer after its surgical removal, a form of intraoperative radiation therapy.","label":"clarity","raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","coherence"]}

{"doc_id":33653387.0,"context":"In this way, Persian became a second language to many across North India;  Alam contends that it neared the status of a first language. By the 18th century, many Indians in the north of the subcontinent had a \"native speaker's competence in Persian\".Faruqi, Shamsur Rahman (2003), \"A Long History of Urdu Literarature, Part 1\", in Pollock (ed.), Literary cultures in history: reconstructions from South Asia, p. 849, Decline Following Aurangzeb's death, Persian began to fall into decline, being displaced by Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu). The arrival and strengthening of British political power added a growing influence of English as well. However, for a long time Persian was still the dominant language of the subcontinent, used in education, Muslim rule, the judiciary, and literature. The East India Company acknowledged Persian as a \"language of command\", necessary to communicate with and control the Indian population. Hence many British officials arriving in India learned Persian in colleges established by the Company. The teachers in these colleges were often Indian. In some cases, Britishers even took over as Persian professors, sidelining the role of the Indians. Deccan A Persian poem produced in the Deccan. 17th century.|346x346px Although considerably distanced from North India, the Deccan was also a recipient of Persian's linguistic impact. Persianate culture was brought to the Deccan fleetingly through the efforts of the Delhi Sultanate in the early 14th century. Persian finally gained a foothold in the region with the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate in 1347, which used the language for official purposes. The dynasty had a great interest in Persian culture, and several members were proficient in the language, producing their own literature. Literati from Northern India found themselves welcome at the court, and scholars from Iran were invited as well. Madrasas were built over the expanse of the kingdom, most notably the Mahmud Gawan Madrasa at Bidar, where Persian was taught.  In spite of this, Persian did not achieve the linguistic penetration it had in the north of the subcontinent. Richard Eaton writes that Persian was much less widely understood in the  region than vernacular languages  . During the turn of the 16th century, the Bahmani Sultanate splintered into the Deccan Sultanates, which were also Persianate in culture. They used Persian as a courtly language, as well as for official and administrative purposes. The language received literary patronage  . However, the sultans simultaneously promoted regional languages such as Telugu, Marathi, and Deccani (the southern variety of Hindustani), at times even using them in administration.  The reign of the Deccan Sultanates lasted until the late 17th century, when Aurangzeb brought the region into the Mughal Empire and established Aurangabad as the Deccan's capital. As was Mughal practice, Persian was used in many levels of administration. Major cities of this region that served as centres of Persian patronage included Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda. Notable Persian literature produced includes Futuh-us-Salatin, and the Bahmannamh . Influence on Indic languages As a prestige language and lingua franca over a period of 800 years in the Indian subcontinent, Classical Persian exerted a vast influence over numerous Indic languages. Generally speaking, the degree of impact is seen to increase the more one moves towards the north-west of the subcontinent, i.e. the Indo-Iranian frontier. For example, the Indo-Aryan languages have the most impact from Persian; this ranges from a high appearance in Punjabi, Sindhi, Kashmiri, and Gujarati, to more moderate representation in Bengali and Marathi. The largest foreign element in the Indo-Aryan languages is Persian. Conversely, the Dravidian languages have seen a low level of influence from Persian. They still feature loans from the language, some of which are direct, and some through Deccani (the southern variety of Hindustani), due to the Islamic rulers of the Deccan. Telugu is a good example of this (see Telangana Baasha for the Telugu dialect accentuated with these features).

Though Arabic largely dominates the realm of Islamic liturgy and theology in the Indian subcontinent, Persian can also be seen in some religious spheres: the dhikr sessions of Sufism often employ Persian poetry in song, and the Sufi devotional music genre of qawwali also uses Persian in parallel with local languages.

{"doc_id":25893514.0,"context":"When breast cancer is surgically excised, it can come back (local recurrence) in the remaining breast or on the chest wall in a small proportion of women. Adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary if breast cancer is treated by removing only the cancerous lump with a rim of surrounding normal tissue, as it reduces the chance of local recurrence significantly . When cancer does come back, it most commonly occurs in the tissues surrounding the original cancer (the tumour bed), even though there are multicentric cancers in remote areas of the breast. This suggests that it is most important to treat the tumour bed. The rationale for TARGIT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the tumour bed. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumour have been time tested and proven to be effective. EBRT is usually given as a course of whole breast radiotherapy and an additional tumour bed boost  . However, it has a few drawbacks; for example, the tumour bed where the boost dose should be applied can be missed (\"geographical miss\") due to the difficulties in localization of the complex wound cavity  even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay (\"temporal miss\") between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumour cells  . These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumour cells. Furthermore, TARGIT inhibits the stimulating effects of wound fluid on cancer cells, suggesting for the first time, a beneficial effect of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) on tumour microenvironment. In these studies, women treated with  TARGIT-IORT  during lumpectomy for breast cancer combined with whole breast radiotherapy had a significantly low mortality from non-breast-cancer causes, such as cardiovascular and lung complications, as well as other cancers compared with those who received whole breast radiotherapy. Therefore, this reduction was thought to be due to the delivery of TARGIT-IORT to the fresh tumour bed during the trauma of surgery rather than avoidance of scattered radiation from whole breast radiotherapy .","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Furthermore, TARGIT inhibits the stimulating effects of wound fluid on cancer cells, suggesting for the first time, a beneficial effect of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) on tumour microenvironment.

However, the Confederation generated resistances among several groups in both countries , which resented the dilution of national identities , and also among neighbouring countries.

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind.","after_edit":" All the academic-history projects mentioned above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind.","label":"clarity","raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","meaning-changed"]}

The Martlet 2G-1 was a proposed space launch vehicle variant of Martlet 2G, which had a solid rocket motor in the projectile.

{"doc_id":51488038.0,"context":"The vulture and the little girl, also known as \"The Struggling Girl\", is a famous photograph by Kevin Carter which first appeared in The New York Times on 26 March 1993. It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a hooded vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan (now South Sudan), in March 1993, and to have survived the incident. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. Carter took his own life four months after winning the prize. Background The Hunger Triangle, a name URLanisations used in the 1990s for the area defined by the southern Sudan communities Kongor, Ayod, and Waat, was dependent on UNESCO and other URLanisations to fight famine. Forty percent of the area's children under 5 years old were malnourished as of January 1993, and an estimated 10 to 13 adults died of starvation daily in Ayod alone. To raise awareness of the situation, Operation Lifeline Sudan invited photojournalists and others, previously excluded from entering the country, to report on conditions. In March 1993, the government began granting visas to journalists for a 24-hour stay with severe restrictions on their travel within the country, including government supervision at all times. Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan. It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva saw this as a chance to work more as a war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested in going. According to fellow war photographer Greg Marinovich, Carter saw the trip as an opportunity to fix some problems \"he felt trapped in\". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\". To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have \"great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan pancake\", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: \"The UN hoped to publish the famine Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for URLanisations to sustain funding\". About the political differences and fighting \"Joo and Kevin knew none of this they just wanted to get in and shoot pictures\". Waiting in Nairobi Silva and Carter had prepared carefully for the trip. They stopped in Nairobi on their way to Sudan. The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region . But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod. In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards. The residents of the hamlet have been looked after by the UN aid station for some time. Greg Marinovich and Joo Silva described that in the book The Bang Bang Club, Chapter 10 \"Flies and Hungry People\". The child was already cared for before Kevin Carter and Joo Silva landed there and Carter took his famous picture. Marinovich wrote that the villagers were already waiting next to the runway to get the food as quickly as possible: \"Mothers who had joined the throng waiting for food left their children on the sandy ground nearby.\" Silva and Carter separated to take pictures of both children and adults, both the living and dead, all victims of the catastrophic famine that had arisen through the war. Carter went several times to Silva to tell him about the shocking situation he had just photographed. Witnessing the famine affected him emotionally. Silva was searching for rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority and when he found some soldiers Carter joined him. The soldiers did not speak English, but one was interested in Carter's watch. Carter gave him his cheap wristwatch as a gift. The soldiers became their bodyguards and followed them for their protection. To stay a week with the rebels they needed the permission of a rebel commander. Their plane was due to depart in an hour and without the permission to stay they would be forced to fly out. Again they separated and Silva went to the clinic complex to ask for the rebel commander and he was told the commander was in Kongor, South Sudan. This was good news for Silva, as \"their little UN plane was heading there next\". He left the clinic and went back to the runway, taking pictures of children and adults on his way. He came across a child lying on his face in the hot sun he took a picture. In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of \"fevers\", according to his family.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region .","after_edit":" Carter flew with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region .","label":"clarity","raw_intents":["clarity","clarity","coherence"]}

G. (2011). The role of goal orientation in leadership development. Human Resource Development Quarterly, 22(2), 157-175. Studies have also used goal orientation to predict sales performance, adaptive performanceStasielowicz, L. (2019). Goal orientation and performance adaptation: A meta-analysis. Journal of Research in Personality, 82., goal setting, learning and adaptive behaviors in training, and leadership. Historical perspective Dweck proposed that there are two types of goal orientation: learning orientation and performance orientation.Dweck, C.S. (1986). Motivational processes affecting learning. American Psychologist, 41, 1040-1048. Dweck postulated that children with learning goals were believed to approach situations to master the acquisition of new skills, while children with performance goals were believed to approach situations to gain approval from peers and teachers. Like Eison, Dweck conceptualized goal orientation as a two-dimension construct. Individuals with a learning goal orientation (sometimes referred to as mastery goal orientation; abbreviated as LGO) seek to develop their competence by acquiring new skills and mastering new situations. They are not concerned about their performance relative to others, but rather with furthering their understanding of a given topic or task.Hendricks, J.W., & Payne, S.C. (2007). Beyond the Big Five: Leader goal orientation as a predictor of leadership effectiveness. Human Performance, 20, 317-343. Individuals with a performance goal orientation seek to demonstrate and validate the adequacy of their competence to receive favorable compliments while avoiding negative judgments. Although Dweck's work in this area built on the foundation laid by Nicholls, the fundamental difference between the two scholars' works was the attribution of an individual's goal orientation: Nicholls believed that the goal orientation held by an individual was a result of the possession of either an internal or external referent, while Dweck considered the adoption of a particular goal orientation to be related to the theory of intelligence held by that individual. Subsequent work by Eison and colleagues in 1982 led to a change in the conceptualization of these orientations from two ends of a continuum to two separate constructs.Eison, J.A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1982). LOGO II: A user's manual. Knoxville: University of Tennessee, Learning Research Center. More recently, researchers have embraced the idea that individuals can adopt the two orientation styles simultaneously: persons can be independently high or low in learning and performance orientations. Ultimately, individuals can entertain multiple competing goal orientations at the same time, and strive to both outperform competitors and improve their performance. This line of thinking led to the conceptualization of two separate continua: one for learning goal orientation and one for performance goal orientation.Eison, J. A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1986). Educational and personal characteristics of four different types of learning- and grade-oriented students. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 11, 5467. State versus trait There has been great debate as to whether goal orientation should be operationalized as a state or as a trait. Throughout the goal orientation literature, there are inconsistencies about the conceptualization of the stability of the construct. For example, DeShon & Gillespie stated that in the literature, DeShon, R. P., & Gillespie, J. Z. (2005). A motivated action theory account of goal orientation. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(6), 1096-1127. goal orientation has been conceptualized as a trait, quasi-trait, and state. They states that whether researchers conceptualize goal orientation as a trait or a state \"depends on the breadth of the inference that the researcher is attempting to support\". State goal orientation refers to the goal one has in a particular situation . It is similar to trait goal orientation in that it represents one's preference in an achievement situation. Button, Mathieu, & Zajac take an integrative view of the construct,Button, S. B., Mathieu, J. E., & Zajac, D. M. (1996, July). Goal orientation URLanizational research: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 67(1), 26-48. stating that goal orientation is best categorized as a relatively stable individual difference variable that can be influenced by situational and contextual characteristics. They found that when few situational cues are present, individuals will adopt their dispositional goal orientations. However, when \"dispositional goal orientations predispose individuals to adopt particular response patterns across situations, situational characteristics may cause them to adopt a different or less acute response pattern for a specific situation\". Therefore, trait and state goal orientations interact, and both should be considered simultaneously. Types Since the realization that performance goal orientation is most effectively split into two separate parts, researchers have conducted validation studies to demonstrate the statistical and conceptual distinction of three dimensions to goal orientation. Conceptual and empirical work by Elliot and Church and VandeWalle demonstrated that the factor structure of goal orientation lends itself to three distinct dimensions as summarized below .Elliot, A. J. Church, M. A. (1997). A hierarchical model of approach and avoidance achievement motivation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, 218-232. An explanation of the learning-approach and learning-avoidance goal orientations are also included for completeness. Antecedents Throughout the goal orientation literature, many studies have examined relationships between goal orientation and various antecedents. These antecedents have been identified to have varying levels of importance. In a meta-analysis by Payne et al., both the need for achievement and the Big Five personality traits were identified as important antecedents of goal orientation, while cognitive ability was found to have almost no relationship with goal orientation. The following sections go into more detail about each antecedent. Payne and her colleagues did not distinguish between proximal and distal antecedents. Another factor to consider when examining the relationship between goal orientation and goal setting is the level of inherent complexity in the situation or task. In situations with more complex tasks, it appears that \"do your best\" goals may lead to higher performance than specific goals. It is possible that in complex tasks, a specific, difficult goal imposes greater cognitive demands on employees, making it difficult for them to learn the complex task due to this increased pressure.Latham, G.P & Seijts, G.H. (1999). The effects of proximal and distal goals on performance on a moderately complex task. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 2, 81-127. Kanfer and Ackerman found that in an air traffic controller simulation (a highly complex task),Kanfer, R. Ackerman, P. L. (1989). Motivation and cognitive abilities: An integrative\/aptitude-treatment interaction approach to skill acquisition. Journal of Applied Psychology, 74, 657-690. performance-outcome goals interfered with acquiring the knowledge necessary to perform the task, and individuals performed better when they were asked to do their best, suggesting that adopting a learning orientation may be appropriate for complex tasks or in specific settings. However, it may be possible to set a specific, difficult learning goal. Latham and Brown found that when MBA students set specific, difficult learning goals such as mastering complex course material,Latham, G. P. Brown, T. C. (2006). The effect of learning vs. outcome goals on self-efficacy and satisfaction in an MBA program. Applied Psychology: An International Review, 55, 606-623. they outperformed MBA students who set a performance goal for GPA. Locke and Latham claim that creating a specific, difficult learning goal in this type of situation facilitates meta-cognition which is particularly helpful in complex environments with limited guidance, such as in an MBA program. Organizational outcomes Goal orientation has also been linked URLanizational outcomes, specifically job performance. Payne et al. found that individuals with high levels of trait and state LGO and low levels of trait APGO had better job performance, that PPGO was unrelated to performance, and that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond both cognitive ability and the Big Five personality characteristics. Their findings suggest that LGO is a valuable predictor of job performance and it may be in the best interest URLanizations to create a climate in which learning is valued over performance.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" They found that when few situational cues are present, individuals will adopt their dispositional goal orientations.","after_edit":" They found that when few situational cues are present, individuals  adopt their dispositional goal orientations.","label":"clarity","raw_intents":["coherence","clarity","clarity"]}

Pollen tube formation is important for sexual reproduction to occur in seed plants. Wind, water or pollinators transport pollen grains to the female gametophyte. Once a pollen grain has implanted on a compatible stigma via self-incompatibility mechanisms, the germination process is initiated. During this process, the pollen grain undergoes a conformational change whereupon a given section begins to protrude outwards to form a tube-like structure, known as the pollen tube. This structure rapidly descends down the length of the style via tip-directed growth, reaching rates of 1cm\/h, whilst carrying two non-motile sperm cells. Upon reaching the ovule the pollen tube ruptures, thereby delivering the sperm cells to the female gametophyte, ultimately resulting in a double fertilization event.

The innovator's dilemma: When new technologies cause great firms to fail. Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I. C. 1985. Milestones for successful venture planning.

A discovery driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements: Definition of success for the plan or initiative, including a 'reverse' income statement Benchmarking against market and competitive parameters Specification of operational requirements Documentation of assumptions Specification of key checkpoints Using discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost. The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered 'real' options.

Green hunting would typically be performed when tranquilization of the animal is necessary for veterinary, monitoring , or translocation purposes. Green hunting has been advocated as a conservation-minded alternative to destructive sport hunting, because it allows the hunter to experience the thrill of a traditional hunt without killing the animal, leaving the wildlife abundance undiminished and  contributing directly to conservation initiatives. The measurements and details of a tranquilized animal are accepted in URLanization's record books and fiberglass replicas can be made for the hunter. There are some  advantages of eco-hunting . The hunter may have the additional option to be kept regularly updated on the animal's future movements if the darting was part of a GPS collaring project. Though still costly (sometimes upwards of $25,000 USD), green hunting is more economical as fees are lower than trophy hunting (up to $ 60,000 USD). The fees finance the conservation project that necessitates an immobilized animal for micro-chipping , ear-notching, tissue collection or GPS tracking and any additional funds can be used to support the management of the protected area involved.

The Martlet 2G-1 was a proposed space launch vehicle variant of Martlet 2G, which had a solid rocket motor in the projectile. The follow-on 2G-2 proposal was to have had a second rocket motor in order to be able to place the second stage in orbit, though with little or no payload.

Martlet 3 The Martlet 3 series consisted of advanced rocket-propelled projectiles. They were built and tested for the HARP project but were ultimately not successful due to restrictions in funding and a severe lack of technical information regarding the behavior of large rocket grains  under high acceleration loading.

Martlet 3E The Martlet 3E was a suborbital solid rocket designed to be fired from a smaller, 7-inch (180mm) cannon used in the HARP project. Its basic concept revolved around packaging the rocket grain in a case with elastic properties to transmit the lateral strain to the gun tube. The 3E model utilized a new technique of rocket grain construction  that consisted of laminating sheet double-base propellant grain under hydraulic pressure. Martlet 4 By July 1964, the Marlet 4 program pursued the development of an orbit capable multi-stage rocket system to be launched from the 16\" Barbados gun. Two versions of full-scale orbital launch vehicle projectiles were proposed in the Martlet 4 series. The first was to have used three solid rocket motor stages and was planned to orbit approximately 50 pounds of payload. The second used liquid rocket motors and was planned to have orbited 200 pounds of payload. Both were about long and in diameter, weighing about at launch. However, no Martlet 4 vehicles were built; the project was halted before the design was completed.

The agreement was negotiated and concluded in Brussels under the auspices of the European Union and signed on 19 April 2013. Negotiations were led by Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dai and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Thai and mediated by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton. The government of Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as a sovereign state, but began normalizing relations with the government of Kosovo nonetheless, in accordance with the Brussels URL Background Following the Kosovo War and NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Kosovo, as part of Serbia and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was placed under United Nations administration under UNSC Resolution 1244. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence and has since been recognized by 96 countries. However, Serbia maintains that Kosovo continues to be its territory. Kosovo has become a member of several URLanizations, while according to Serbia and about half of the UN member states, Resolution 1244 remains legally binding on all parties. The EU-mediated dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia was launched in March 2011, three years after Kosovo declared URL Belgrade and Pristina were urged to continue talks in Brussels, but Serbia was not obliged to recognize Kosovo at any point in the URL Talks Until preset, ten rounds of talks have been held at the European External Action Service office in Brussels. Baroness Ashton, the EU High Representative, had been chairing talks for two years, followed by Federica Mogherini. Normalization of relations with neighboring states is a key precondition for states wishing to join the EU; the Brussels Agreement brought Serbia close to EU accession talks and Kosovo to initialing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). The SAA was signed by HR Mogherini and PM Mustafa in October 2015. Removing the parallel Serbian structures in the Northern part of Kosovo remains challenging. 330px|Ivica Dai, Prime Minister of Serbia (left), Catherine Ashton (middle), and Hashim Thai, Prime Minister of Kosovo (right) in Munich, 2014. United States diplomats have supported the EU-led dialogue from the beginning. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton invited Baroness Ashton to undertake joint travel in the Balkans, and the two made joint visits to Belgrade and Pristina (as well as Sarajevo) in October 2012. Clinton assigned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State ambassador Philip Reeker to support Ashton's efforts. Reeker and his team coordinated closely with EU colleagues and met with Serbian and Kosovar representatives on the margins of every dialogue session in Brussels, and during visits to the region. The result was the 15-point \"First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalisation of Relations\", initialed but not signed on 19 April 2013. After the agreement was concluded, the European Commission officially advised that work start on an SAA with Kosovo, and accession negotiations began with Serbia. The agreement was supported by the European Union, NATO, the OSCE, and the United Nations. In October 2013, arrangements were made for Serbian officials to visit North Kosovo. It was agreed that electoral bodies in Kosovo would include Kosovo Serb representatives and that international dialing code +383 would be attributed to Kosovo. The new code was expected to go into effect in late 2015 but has again been delayed by Serbia until March 2016. The geographic phone code was implemented in December 2016.

{"doc_id":1556660.0,"context":"Gray death is a slang term used for a potent mixture of synthetic opioids. Samples have been found to contain the designer drug U-47700, heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil . It is taken by injection, smoking, snorting, or oral ingestion. It was first discovered in the United States and was thought to be a unique chemical compound before being identified as a mixture of drugs. In addition to containing powerful opioids, what makes gray death an extremely dangerous drug is the fact that the constituent drugs' identities, their overall ratios in the product, and their uneven distribution within the productare completely unknown to the user. This means that the user cannot predict what dose to safely take; even two identical doses by mass may contain more or less of an unknown substance due to uneven physical distribution, as seen with heroin and fentanyl mixes. Opioid addicts tend to be more susceptible to the drug . They may think they are buying heroin, unaware that it is actually gray death. Reversing a gray death overdose frequently requires multiple doses of naloxone , whereas a typical overdose of heroin (which is much less potent) typically needs only one dose. This is consistent with the difficulty of overdose reversal seen with high-affinity opioids in the fentanyl chemical family or with buprenorphine. The greater affinity of these substances for the -opioid receptor causes less naloxoneto bind to receptors, increasing the dosage necessary to counteract the resulting respiratory depression. The difficulty in reversing an overdose of gray death is likely due to the presence of a fentanyl analogue, which reporting seems to corroborate as of December 2018.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Samples have been found to contain the designer drug U-47700, heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil .","after_edit":" Samples have been found to contain  heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil .","label":"coherence","raw_intents":["coherence","coherence","clarity"]}

{"doc_id":5467330.0,"context":"Herbert Richard Baumeister (April 7, 1947 July 3, 1996) was an American  suspected serial killer. A resident of the Indianapolis suburb of Westfield, Indiana, he was under investigation for murdering over a dozen men in the early 1990s, most of whom were last seen at gay bars. Police found the remains of eleven persons, eight identified, on Baumeister's property. After an arrest warrant was issued, Baumeister fled to Canada and killed himself before he could be brought to trial. He never confessed to the crimes and his suicide note made no mention of the murder allegations. He was later linked to a series of murders of at least nine men along Interstate 70, which occurred in the early to mid-1980s. Early life  Baumeister was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the oldest of four children born to Herbert and Elizabeth Baumeister. His childhood was reportedly normal . By the onset of adolescence, he began exhibiting anti-social behavior . Acquaintances later recalled the young Baumeister playing with dead animals and urinating on a teacher's desk , which are textbook signs of a burgeoning serial killer . In his teens, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia , but did not receive further psychiatric treatment. In 1965, Baumeister attended Indiana University for a semester before dropping out, but returned in 1967. In 1972, he attended a semester at Butler University. As an adult, he drifted through a series of jobs, marked by a strong work ethic , but also by increasingly bizarre behavior. Baumeister married Juliana \"Julie\" Saiter in November 1971, a union that produced three children. Julie later said they had been sexually intimate only six times in over 25 years of marriage. In the 1970s, Baumeister was committed to a psychiatric hospital by his father . His wife said he was \"hurting and needed help.\" Baumeister founded the successful Sav-A-Lot thrift store chain (two stores total) in Indianapolis in 1988. Investigation By the early 1990s, investigators with the Marion County Sheriff's Department and the Indianapolis Police Department began investigating the disappearances of gay men of similar age, height, and weight in the Indianapolis area. In 1992, they were contacted by a man named Tony Harris claiming that a gay bar patron calling himself \"Brian Smart\" had killed a friend of his, and had attempted to kill him with a pool hose during an erotic asphyxiation session. Harris eventually saw this man again in August 1995, following him and noting a license plate number. From this data, police identified \"Brian Smart\" as Herb Baumeister. Investigators approached Baumeister, told him he was a suspect in the disappearances, and asked to search his house. Both Baumeister and his wife, Julie, refused to allow a search of their house . By June 1996, however, Julie had become sufficiently frightened by her husband's mood swings and erratic behavior that, after filing for divorce, she consented to a search. The search of the estate, Fox Hollow Farm, was conducted while Baumeister was on vacation. It turned up the remains of eleven men, eight of whom were identified. Baumeister would posthumously be suspected of killing nine other men, the bodies of whom were found in rural areas along the corridor of Interstate 70 between Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio  during the early to mid 1980s. One eyewitness identified Baumeister as the man seen leaving a bar in 1983 with Michael Riley, who was later found dead. Like the other victims, Riley was strangled to death and deposited nude or semi-nude in a river.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Acquaintances later recalled the young Baumeister playing with dead animals and urinating on a teacher's desk , which are textbook signs of a burgeoning serial killer .","after_edit":" Acquaintances later recalled the young Baumeister playing with dead animals and urinating on a teacher's desk  .","label":"coherence","raw_intents":["coherence","coherence","clarity"]}

They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States .

Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years. Despite devastating population losses to European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, these Atlantic First Nations held on to their traditional coastal or river locations for hunting, fishing and gathering , and were concentrated along river valleys for trapping.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States .","after_edit":" The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America .

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center.

{"doc_id":1556660.0,"context":"Gray death is a slang term used for a potent mixture of synthetic opioids. Samples have been found to contain the designer drug U-47700, heroin, fentanyl, and carfentanil . It is taken by injection, smoking, snorting, or oral ingestion. It was first discovered in the United States and was thought to be a unique chemical compound before being identified as a mixture of drugs. In addition to containing powerful opioids, what makes gray death an extremely dangerous drug is the fact that the constituent drugs' identities, their overall ratios in the product, and their uneven distribution within the productare completely unknown to the user. This means that the user cannot predict what dose to safely take; even two identical doses by mass may contain more or less of an unknown substance due to uneven physical distribution, as seen with heroin and fentanyl mixes. Opioid addicts tend to be more susceptible to the drug . They may think they are buying heroin, unaware that it is actually gray death. Reversing a gray death overdose frequently requires multiple doses of naloxone , whereas a typical overdose of heroin (which is much less potent) typically needs only one dose. This is consistent with the difficulty of overdose reversal seen with high-affinity opioids in the fentanyl chemical family or with buprenorphine. The greater affinity of these substances for the -opioid receptor causes less naloxoneto bind to receptors, increasing the dosage necessary to counteract the resulting respiratory depression. The difficulty in reversing an overdose of gray death is likely due to the presence of a fentanyl analogue, which reporting seems to corroborate as of December 2018.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" The difficulty in reversing an overdose of gray death is likely due to the presence of a fentanyl analogue, which reporting seems to corroborate as of December 2018.","after_edit":" ","label":"coherence","raw_intents":["clarity","coherence","coherence"]}
{"doc_id":51488038.0,"context":"The vulture and the little girl, also known as \"The Struggling Girl\", is a famous photograph by Kevin Carter which first appeared in The New York Times on 26 March 1993. It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a hooded vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan (now South Sudan), in March 1993, and to have survived the incident. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. Carter took his own life four months after winning the prize. Background The Hunger Triangle, a name URLanisations used in the 1990s for the area defined by the southern Sudan communities Kongor, Ayod, and Waat, was dependent on UNESCO and other URLanisations to fight famine. Forty percent of the area's children under 5 years old were malnourished as of January 1993, and an estimated 10 to 13 adults died of starvation daily in Ayod alone. To raise awareness of the situation, Operation Lifeline Sudan invited photojournalists and others, previously excluded from entering the country, to report on conditions. In March 1993, the government began granting visas to journalists for a 24-hour stay with severe restrictions on their travel within the country, including government supervision at all times. Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan. It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva saw this as a chance to work more as a war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested in going. According to fellow war photographer Greg Marinovich, Carter saw the trip as an opportunity to fix some problems \"he felt trapped in\". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\". To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have \"great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan pancake\", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: \"The UN hoped to publish the famine Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for URLanisations to sustain funding\". About the political differences and fighting \"Joo and Kevin knew none of this they just wanted to get in and shoot pictures\". Waiting in Nairobi Silva and Carter had prepared carefully for the trip. They stopped in Nairobi on their way to Sudan. The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region . But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod. In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards. The residents of the hamlet have been looked after by the UN aid station for some time. Greg Marinovich and Joo Silva described that in the book The Bang Bang Club, Chapter 10 \"Flies and Hungry People\". The child was already cared for before Kevin Carter and Joo Silva landed there and Carter took his famous picture. Marinovich wrote that the villagers were already waiting next to the runway to get the food as quickly as possible: \"Mothers who had joined the throng waiting for food left their children on the sandy ground nearby.\" Silva and Carter separated to take pictures of both children and adults, both the living and dead, all victims of the catastrophic famine that had arisen through the war. Carter went several times to Silva to tell him about the shocking situation he had just photographed. Witnessing the famine affected him emotionally. Silva was searching for rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority and when he found some soldiers Carter joined him. The soldiers did not speak English, but one was interested in Carter's watch. Carter gave him his cheap wristwatch as a gift. The soldiers became their bodyguards and followed them for their protection. To stay a week with the rebels they needed the permission of a rebel commander. Their plane was due to depart in an hour and without the permission to stay they would be forced to fly out. Again they separated and Silva went to the clinic complex to ask for the rebel commander and he was told the commander was in Kongor, South Sudan. This was good news for Silva, as \"their little UN plane was heading there next\". He left the clinic and went back to the runway, taking pictures of children and adults on his way. He came across a child lying on his face in the hot sun he took a picture. In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station.

The main gate of the Nyumba ya Sanaa cultural centre in Dar es Salaam has decorations by Lilanga URLe Lilanga (right) and fellow painter Patrick Francis Imanjama outside Nyumba ya Sanaa In 1970, Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures and practising contemporary art. In 1971, he found his first employment, thanks to his uncle, Augustino Malaba, an already well-known sculptor, who would be his future collaborator. He worked as a night guard at the House of Art (Nyumba ya Sanaa), a  centre for the development of African art and craftsmanship in Dar es Salaam. Lilanga's talents were soon recognized by Jean Pruitt, an American aid worker promoting Tanzanian art. Lilanga welcomed  other artists like Robino Ntila, Augustino Malaba and Patrick Francis Imanjama to join Nyumba ya Sanaa . He also began to create paintings on batik cloth, on goatskin and on metal sheets for the finishing of railings and gates of the centre.  In 1977, he made his first journey outside Africa, travelling to New York, where he had a show at the Maryknoll Sisters Ossining Center . He stayed for a brief time in Manhattan, selling prints made on paper or cardboard, standing on street corners. Artistic development & success Shortly after beginning grammar school, Lilanga had his first contact with sculpture ( roots, softwood and, later, hard ebony), working in the Makonde tradition. He dedicated himself almost exclusively to this technique from 1961 until 1972. He showed his first works to Europeans who worked in the refugee camps during Mozambique's war of independence. Following their advice, in 1970 Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures. A lot of URLe Lilanga's lifetime art works can be found in leading international collections like The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi or the Hamburg Mawingu Collection HMC of German collector Peter-Andreas Kamphausen. Directly after the death of the artist, the HMC: URLe Lilanga Collection presented the first systematically and thematically complete catalogue of Lilanga's work. In addition, the book explores the traditional roots of East African Makonde art, as well as four decades of Lilanga's artistic development with different materials and techniques, including sculpture, paintings, etchings, drawings and metal works. Currently the HMC publish the URLe Lilanga News as an online blog with information about the artist, his art works, exhibitions and other interesting background material.

{"doc_id":172474.0,"context":"Exercise and lactate During power exercises such as sprinting, when the rate of demand for energy is high, glucose is broken down and oxidized to pyruvate , and lactate is then produced from the pyruvate faster than the body can process it, causing lactate concentrations to rise.  The production of lactate is beneficial for NAD+ regeneration (pyruvate is reduced to lactate while NADH is oxidized to NAD+), which is used up in oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate during production of pyruvate from glucose, and this ensures that energy production is maintained and exercise can continue. During intense exercise, the respiratory chain cannot keep up with the amount of hydrogen ions that join to form NADH, and cannot regenerate NAD+ quickly enough. However, lactate is continually formed at rest and during all exercise intensities. With the use of stable isotopic tracers URLe Brooks and colleagues, at the University of California, Berkeley, observed that lactate served as a metabolic fuel being produced and oxidatively disposed in resting and exercising muscle. Some causes of this are metabolism in red blood cells that lack mitochondria, and limitations resulting from the enzyme activity that occurs in muscle fibers having high glycolytic capacity. In 2004, Robergs et al. maintained that lactic acidosis during exercise is a \"construct\" or myth, pointing out that part of the H+ comes from ATP hydrolysis (ATP4 + H2O ADP3 + + H+), and that reducing pyruvate to lactate (pyruvate + NADH + H+ lactate + NAD+) actually consumes H+. Lindinger et al. countered that they had ignored the causative factors of the increase in [H+]. After all, the production of lactate from a neutral molecule must increase [H+] to maintain electroneutrality. The point of Robergs's paper, however, was that lactate is produced from pyruvate, which has the same charge. It is pyruvate production from neutral glucose that generates H+: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Subsequent lactate production absorbs these protons: 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH 2 + 2NAD+ Overall: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O 2 + 2NAD+ + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Although the reaction glucose 2lactate + 2H+ releases two H+ when viewed on its own, the H+ are absorbed in the production of ATP. On the other hand, the absorbed acidity is released during subsequent hydrolysis of ATP: ATP4 + H2O ADP3 + + H+. So once the use of ATP is included, the overall reaction is C6H12O6 2 + 2H+","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" However, lactate is continually formed at rest and during all exercise intensities.

{"doc_id":33653387.0,"context":"In this way, Persian became a second language to many across North India;  Alam contends that it neared the status of a first language. By the 18th century, many Indians in the north of the subcontinent had a \"native speaker's competence in Persian\".Faruqi, Shamsur Rahman (2003), \"A Long History of Urdu Literarature, Part 1\", in Pollock (ed.), Literary cultures in history: reconstructions from South Asia, p. 849, Decline Following Aurangzeb's death, Persian began to fall into decline, being displaced by Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu). The arrival and strengthening of British political power added a growing influence of English as well. However, for a long time Persian was still the dominant language of the subcontinent, used in education, Muslim rule, the judiciary, and literature. The East India Company acknowledged Persian as a \"language of command\", necessary to communicate with and control the Indian population. Hence many British officials arriving in India learned Persian in colleges established by the Company. The teachers in these colleges were often Indian. In some cases, Britishers even took over as Persian professors, sidelining the role of the Indians. Deccan A Persian poem produced in the Deccan. 17th century.|346x346px Although considerably distanced from North India, the Deccan was also a recipient of Persian's linguistic impact. Persianate culture was brought to the Deccan fleetingly through the efforts of the Delhi Sultanate in the early 14th century. Persian finally gained a foothold in the region with the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate in 1347, which used the language for official purposes. The dynasty had a great interest in Persian culture, and several members were proficient in the language, producing their own literature. Literati from Northern India found themselves welcome at the court, and scholars from Iran were invited as well. Madrasas were built over the expanse of the kingdom, most notably the Mahmud Gawan Madrasa at Bidar, where Persian was taught.  In spite of this, Persian did not achieve the linguistic penetration it had in the north of the subcontinent. Richard Eaton writes that Persian was much less widely understood in the  region than vernacular languages  . During the turn of the 16th century, the Bahmani Sultanate splintered into the Deccan Sultanates, which were also Persianate in culture. They used Persian as a courtly language, as well as for official and administrative purposes. The language received literary patronage  . However, the sultans simultaneously promoted regional languages such as Telugu, Marathi, and Deccani (the southern variety of Hindustani), at times even using them in administration.  The reign of the Deccan Sultanates lasted until the late 17th century, when Aurangzeb brought the region into the Mughal Empire and established Aurangabad as the Deccan's capital. As was Mughal practice, Persian was used in many levels of administration. Major cities of this region that served as centres of Persian patronage included Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda. Notable Persian literature produced includes Futuh-us-Salatin, and the Bahmannamh . Influence on Indic languages As a prestige language and lingua franca over a period of 800 years in the Indian subcontinent, Classical Persian exerted a vast influence over numerous Indic languages. Generally speaking, the degree of impact is seen to increase the more one moves towards the north-west of the subcontinent, i.e. the Indo-Iranian frontier. For example, the Indo-Aryan languages have the most impact from Persian; this ranges from a high appearance in Punjabi, Sindhi, Kashmiri, and Gujarati, to more moderate representation in Bengali and Marathi. The largest foreign element in the Indo-Aryan languages is Persian. Conversely, the Dravidian languages have seen a low level of influence from Persian. They still feature loans from the language, some of which are direct, and some through Deccani (the southern variety of Hindustani), due to the Islamic rulers of the Deccan. Telugu is a good example of this (see Telangana Baasha for the Telugu dialect accentuated with these features).

Some colleges and universities in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh offer Persian as a course of study.  Though Arabic largely dominates the realm of Islamic liturgy and theology in the Indian subcontinent, Persian can also be seen in some religious spheres: the dhikr sessions of Sufism often employ Persian poetry in song, and the Sufi devotional music genre of qawwali also uses Persian in parallel with local languages.

In Australia, Aboriginal land trusts are a type of URLanisation that holds the freehold title to an area of land on behalf of a community of Aboriginal and\/or Torres Strait Islander people. History Ancient example Possible earliest concept of equity in land held in trust is the depiction of this ancient king (trustor) which grants property back to its previous owner (beneficiary) during his absence, supported by witness testimony (trustee). In essence and in this case, the king, in place of the later state (trustor and holder of assets at highest position) issues ownership along with past proceeds (equity) back to the beneficiary:  Land trusts have been actively used in Illinois for over a hundred years and in recent decades have begun to be used in other states. The declaration of a trust is through a \"deed to trustee\". If the trust is filed as a public document, it removes all of the asset protection provided by the formation of the land trust. Robert Pless pioneered the use of the land trust that has been used by many firms throughout the United States since the early 1990s.   Conservation land trusts The Land Trust Alliance, formed in 1981, provides technical support to land trusts in the United States. The Alliance performs a National Land Trust Census that keeps track of the land protected by local and regional land trusts. The last Census, conducted in 2003, reported that these trusts have protected almost 9.4million acres (38,000km2) of land in the United States, double the 4.7million acres (19,000km2) recorded in the 1998 survey. Over 5million acres (20,000km2) of that was protected by conservation easement in 2003. Although it does not include national or international land trusts in its Census, the LTA estimates another 25million acres (100,000km2) in the U.S. have been protected by URLanizations. The largest amount of land protected by local and regional trusts is in the Northeast with 2.9million acres (12,000km2), while the fastest growing region between 1998 and 2003 was the Pacific (consisting of California, Nevada, and Hawaii), with protected land increasing 147\\% to 1.5million acres (6,100km2) in 2003.

{"doc_id":59170248.0,"context":"To some degree the term 'Iron Age' is misapplied, as little evidence exists for any indigenous iron-work outside the finds at Muwailah , themselves thought to be imports, and even the extensive evidence of smelting throughout the Iron Age found at Saruq Al Hadid is dominated by copper and tin production. Iron Age II A pot, discovered in the Iron Age building at Bidaa bint Saud and on display at the Al Ain National Museum. It is thought to be an incense burner. Extensive evidence of Iron Age II settlement has been found throughout the UAE, particularly at Muwailah, Al Thuqeibah, Bidaa bint Saud, as well as Rumailah and Qattara in Al Ain. The development of increasingly complex irrigation ditches and waterways, falaj (plural aflaj) took place during this time and finds at Bidaa bint Saud and Thuqeibah date back to the Iron Age II period pre-dating finds of qanat waterways in Iran. Early finds of aflaj, particularly those around the desert city of Al Ain, have been cited as the earliest evidence of the construction of these waterways. It is thought nearby Bidaa bint Saud became an important site during the Iron Age, both as a caravan stop and as a settled community of farmers that used the falaj irrigation system there. Two of these irrigation passages have been partly excavated at Bidaa bint Saud, with a number of sections remaining in reasonable condition. In one of the excavations, a number of sandstone-lined shaft holes were discovered, as well as a stepped underground access point and a large open cistern. Evidence of formerly irrigated land has also been found at the site. Iron age aflaj Recent finds of pottery in Thuqeibah and Madam have further linked the development of early aflaj ( or qanat ) water systems there to an Iron Age II date, further substantiating the attribution of the innovation of these water systems to a southeastern Arabian origin based on the extensive archaeological work of Dr Wasim Takriti around the area of Al Ain. The 2002 publication of a paper by Tikriti, The south-east Arabian origin of the falaj system, provided the first counterpoint to the long-accepted narrative, that the Qanat originated in Persia and was identified as such by accounts of the campaigns of the Assyrian King, Sargon II, in 714 BCE. Tikriti cites this and also accounts by the Greek second and third century historian Polybius as being the basis for academic attribution of the technology to Persia. He notes academics such as JC Wilkinson (1977) adopting an Iranian origin for the technology under the influence of Sargon's annals and Polybius, but points out at least seven Iron Age aflaj (plural for falaj, the word used to denote waterways of this type in the United Arab Emirates) recently discovered in the Al Ain area of the UAE have been reliably carbon dated back to the beginning of the first millennium BCE. Additional to finds of Iron Age aflaj in Al Ain, Tikrit pointed to excavations in Al Madam, Sharjah, by the French archaeological team working there, as well as by a German team working in Maysar, in Oman. Tikriti is at pains to point out that, despite long-standing efforts since the 19th century to excavate qanat systems in Iran, no evidence has been found for any such qanat there dated earlier than the 5th century BCE. He concludes that the technology originated in South East Arabia and was likely taken to Persia, likely by the Sasanian conquest of the Oman peninsular. Others have followed Tikriti's lead. In 2016, Rmy Boucharlat in his paper Qant and Falaj: Polycentric and Multi-Period Innovations Iran and the United Arab Emirates as Case Studies, asserted that the attribution of the technology to Iranians in the early first millennium BCE is a position that cannot longer be maintained . He asserts that the carbon dating of alfaj in Oman and the UAE to the ninth century BCE by Cleuziou and evidence for such an early date provided by Tikriti are definitive. Additionally, Boucharlat maintains that no known Iranian qanat can be dated to the pre-Islamic period. Post Iron Age The period from 3000 BCE has been dubbed both the Mleiha and the Late Pre-Islamic period, and follows on from the dissolution of Darius III's empire.

G. (2011). The role of goal orientation in leadership development. Human Resource Development Quarterly, 22(2), 157-175. Studies have also used goal orientation to predict sales performance, adaptive performanceStasielowicz, L. (2019). Goal orientation and performance adaptation: A meta-analysis. Journal of Research in Personality, 82., goal setting, learning and adaptive behaviors in training, and leadership. Historical perspective Dweck proposed that there are two types of goal orientation: learning orientation and performance orientation.Dweck, C.S. (1986). Motivational processes affecting learning. American Psychologist, 41, 1040-1048. Dweck postulated that children with learning goals were believed to approach situations to master the acquisition of new skills, while children with performance goals were believed to approach situations to gain approval from peers and teachers. Like Eison, Dweck conceptualized goal orientation as a two-dimension construct. Individuals with a learning goal orientation (sometimes referred to as mastery goal orientation; abbreviated as LGO) seek to develop their competence by acquiring new skills and mastering new situations. They are not concerned about their performance relative to others, but rather with furthering their understanding of a given topic or task.Hendricks, J.W., & Payne, S.C. (2007). Beyond the Big Five: Leader goal orientation as a predictor of leadership effectiveness. Human Performance, 20, 317-343. Individuals with a performance goal orientation seek to demonstrate and validate the adequacy of their competence to receive favorable compliments while avoiding negative judgments. Although Dweck's work in this area built on the foundation laid by Nicholls, the fundamental difference between the two scholars' works was the attribution of an individual's goal orientation: Nicholls believed that the goal orientation held by an individual was a result of the possession of either an internal or external referent, while Dweck considered the adoption of a particular goal orientation to be related to the theory of intelligence held by that individual. Subsequent work by Eison and colleagues in 1982 led to a change in the conceptualization of these orientations from two ends of a continuum to two separate constructs.Eison, J.A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1982). LOGO II: A user's manual. Knoxville: University of Tennessee, Learning Research Center. More recently, researchers have embraced the idea that individuals can adopt the two orientation styles simultaneously: persons can be independently high or low in learning and performance orientations. Ultimately, individuals can entertain multiple competing goal orientations at the same time, and strive to both outperform competitors and improve their performance. This line of thinking led to the conceptualization of two separate continua: one for learning goal orientation and one for performance goal orientation.Eison, J. A., Pollio, H., & Milton, O. (1986). Educational and personal characteristics of four different types of learning- and grade-oriented students. Contemporary Educational Psychology, 11, 5467. State versus trait There has been great debate as to whether goal orientation should be operationalized as a state or as a trait. Throughout the goal orientation literature, there are inconsistencies about the conceptualization of the stability of the construct. For example, DeShon & Gillespie stated that in the literature, DeShon, R. P., & Gillespie, J. Z. (2005). A motivated action theory account of goal orientation. Journal of Applied Psychology, 90(6), 1096-1127. goal orientation has been conceptualized as a trait, quasi-trait, and state. They states that whether researchers conceptualize goal orientation as a trait or a state \"depends on the breadth of the inference that the researcher is attempting to support\". State goal orientation refers to the goal one has in a particular situation . It is similar to trait goal orientation in that it represents one's preference in an achievement situation. Button, Mathieu, & Zajac take an integrative view of the construct,Button, S. B., Mathieu, J. E., & Zajac, D. M. (1996, July). Goal orientation URLanizational research: A conceptual and empirical foundation. Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 67(1), 26-48. stating that goal orientation is best categorized as a relatively stable individual difference variable that can be influenced by situational and contextual characteristics. They found that when few situational cues are present, individuals will adopt their dispositional goal orientations. However, when \"dispositional goal orientations predispose individuals to adopt particular response patterns across situations, situational characteristics may cause them to adopt a different or less acute response pattern for a specific situation\". Therefore, trait and state goal orientations interact, and both should be considered simultaneously. Types Since the realization that performance goal orientation is most effectively split into two separate parts, researchers have conducted validation studies to demonstrate the statistical and conceptual distinction of three dimensions to goal orientation. Conceptual and empirical work by Elliot and Church and VandeWalle demonstrated that the factor structure of goal orientation lends itself to three distinct dimensions as summarized below .Elliot, A. J. Church, M. A. (1997). A hierarchical model of approach and avoidance achievement motivation. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 72, 218-232. An explanation of the learning-approach and learning-avoidance goal orientations are also included for completeness. Antecedents Throughout the goal orientation literature, many studies have examined relationships between goal orientation and various antecedents. These antecedents have been identified to have varying levels of importance. In a meta-analysis by Payne et al., both the need for achievement and the Big Five personality traits were identified as important antecedents of goal orientation, while cognitive ability was found to have almost no relationship with goal orientation. The following sections go into more detail about each antecedent. Payne and her colleagues did not distinguish between proximal and distal antecedents. Another factor to consider when examining the relationship between goal orientation and goal setting is the level of inherent complexity in the situation or task. In situations with more complex tasks, it appears that \"do your best\" goals may lead to higher performance than specific goals. It is possible that in complex tasks, a specific, difficult goal imposes greater cognitive demands on employees, making it difficult for them to learn the complex task due to this increased pressure.Latham, G.P & Seijts, G.H. (1999). The effects of proximal and distal goals on performance on a moderately complex task. Journal of Organizational Behavior, 2, 81-127. Kanfer and Ackerman found that in an air traffic controller simulation (a highly complex task),Kanfer, R. Ackerman, P. L. (1989). Motivation and cognitive abilities: An integrative\/aptitude-treatment interaction approach to skill acquisition. Journal of Applied Psychology, 74, 657-690. performance-outcome goals interfered with acquiring the knowledge necessary to perform the task, and individuals performed better when they were asked to do their best, suggesting that adopting a learning orientation may be appropriate for complex tasks or in specific settings. However, it may be possible to set a specific, difficult learning goal. Latham and Brown found that when MBA students set specific, difficult learning goals such as mastering complex course material,Latham, G. P. Brown, T. C. (2006). The effect of learning vs. outcome goals on self-efficacy and satisfaction in an MBA program. Applied Psychology: An International Review, 55, 606-623. they outperformed MBA students who set a performance goal for GPA. Locke and Latham claim that creating a specific, difficult learning goal in this type of situation facilitates meta-cognition which is particularly helpful in complex environments with limited guidance, such as in an MBA program. Organizational outcomes Goal orientation has also been linked URLanizational outcomes, specifically job performance. Payne et al. found that individuals with high levels of trait and state LGO and low levels of trait APGO had better job performance, that PPGO was unrelated to performance, and that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond both cognitive ability and the Big Five personality characteristics. Their findings suggest that LGO is a valuable predictor of job performance and it may be in the best interest URLanizations to create a climate in which learning is valued over performance.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Payne et al. found that individuals with high levels of trait and state LGO and low levels of trait APGO had better job performance, that PPGO was unrelated to performance, and that LGO predicted job performance above and beyond both cognitive ability and the Big Five personality characteristics.","after_edit":" Payne et al. found that individuals with high levels of trait and state LGO and low levels of trait APGO had better job performance, that PPGO was unrelated to performance, and  LGO predicted job performance above and beyond both cognitive ability and the Big Five personality characteristics.","label":"coherence","raw_intents":["coherence","others","fluency"]}

The main gate of the Nyumba ya Sanaa cultural centre in Dar es Salaam has decorations by Lilanga URLe Lilanga (right) and fellow painter Patrick Francis Imanjama outside Nyumba ya Sanaa In 1970, Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures and practising contemporary art. In 1971, he found his first employment, thanks to his uncle, Augustino Malaba, an already well-known sculptor, who would be his future collaborator. He worked as a night guard at the House of Art (Nyumba ya Sanaa), a  centre for the development of African art and craftsmanship in Dar es Salaam. Lilanga's talents were soon recognized by Jean Pruitt, an American aid worker promoting Tanzanian art. Lilanga welcomed  other artists like Robino Ntila, Augustino Malaba and Patrick Francis Imanjama to join Nyumba ya Sanaa . He also began to create paintings on batik cloth, on goatskin and on metal sheets for the finishing of railings and gates of the centre.  In 1977, he made his first journey outside Africa, travelling to New York, where he had a show at the Maryknoll Sisters Ossining Center . He stayed for a brief time in Manhattan, selling prints made on paper or cardboard, standing on street corners. Artistic development & success Shortly after beginning grammar school, Lilanga had his first contact with sculpture ( roots, softwood and, later, hard ebony), working in the Makonde tradition. He dedicated himself almost exclusively to this technique from 1961 until 1972. He showed his first works to Europeans who worked in the refugee camps during Mozambique's war of independence. Following their advice, in 1970 Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures. A lot of URLe Lilanga's lifetime art works can be found in leading international collections like The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi or the Hamburg Mawingu Collection HMC of German collector Peter-Andreas Kamphausen. Directly after the death of the artist, the HMC: URLe Lilanga Collection presented the first systematically and thematically complete catalogue of Lilanga's work. In addition, the book explores the traditional roots of East African Makonde art, as well as four decades of Lilanga's artistic development with different materials and techniques, including sculpture, paintings, etchings, drawings and metal works. Currently the HMC publish the URLe Lilanga News as an online blog with information about the artist, his art works, exhibitions and other interesting background material. Also in 2005, the African Collection series (Skira Editore, Milan) published a well-illustrated book on Lilanga's work with useful information.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Artistic development & success Shortly after beginning grammar school, Lilanga had his first contact with sculpture ( roots, softwood and, later, hard ebony), working in the Makonde tradition.","after_edit":" Artistic development & success Shortly after beginning grammar school, Lilanga had his first contact with sculpture ( roots, softwood and, later, ebony, and working in the Makonde tradition.","label":"coherence","raw_intents":["clarity","coherence","coherence"]}

It was tested successfully with the Highwater gun and the Barbados gun but never proceeded beyond the engineering flight testing stage. The Martlet 2G-1 was a proposed space launch vehicle variant of Martlet 2G, which had a solid rocket motor in the projectile. The follow-on 2G-2 proposal was to have had a second rocket motor in order to be able to place the second stage in orbit, though with little or no payload. After development, it underwent horizontal development firings from the Highwater gun in 1966 but failed to be properly tested in time. Martlet 3 The Martlet 3 series consisted of advanced rocket-propelled projectiles. They were built and tested for the HARP project but were ultimately not successful due to restrictions in funding and a severe lack of technical information regarding the behavior of large rocket grains  under high acceleration loading. When testing these projectiles, the danger of in-bore detonation was considered a very serious potential problem. Martlet 3A The Martlet 3A was an diameter, gun-fired rocket projectile that theoretically was able to reach 500km altitude. As HARP's first attempt at a low-cost sabotted rocket system, the projectile was built with fiberglass or aluminum bodies. A standard 6-inch rocket was bonded to an aluminum case , and the rocket nozzle was supported by a pusher plate, which would impart the acceleration thrust to the missile through the aluminum wall casing. Fiberglass limited acceleration to 3600g (corresponding to a velocity of at rocket ignition). The Martlet 3A's original objective was to carry a 40-lbs payload to an altitude of 500km, which theoretically was feasible if the system could be launched at full gun pressures.

Many particular instances of the principle are nevertheless provable there as well. There are many equivalent formulations of Markov's principle, as listed below. In computability theory In the language of computability theory, Markov's principle is a formal expression of the claim that if it is impossible that an algorithm does not terminate, then it does terminate. This is equivalent to the claim that if a set and its complement are both computably enumerable, then the set is decidable.   In constructive analysis It is equivalent, in the language of real analysis, to the following principles: Realizability If constructive arithmetic is translated using realizability into a classical meta-theory that proves the -consistency of the relevant classical theory (for example, Peano Arithmetic if we are studying Heyting arithmetic), then Markov's principle is justified: a realizer is the constant function that takes a realization that is not everywhere false to the unbounded search that successively checks if is true. If is not everywhere false, then by -consistency there must be a term for which holds, and each term will be checked by the search eventually. If however does not hold anywhere, then the domain of the constant function must be empty, so although the search does not halt it still holds vacuously that the function is a realizer. By the Law of the Excluded Middle (in our classical metatheory), must either hold nowhere or not hold nowhere, therefore this constant function is a realizer. If instead the realizability interpretation is used in a constructive meta-theory, then it is not justified. Indeed, for first-order arithmetic, Markov's principle exactly captures the difference between a constructive and classical meta-theory. Specifically, a statement is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Heyting arithmetic; and it is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis and Markov's principle if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Peano arithmetic .","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" If instead the realizability interpretation is used in a constructive meta-theory, then it is not justified.

From the earliest libraries in the ancient world to the modern information hub, there have been keepers and disseminators of the information held in data stores. Roles and responsibilities vary widely depending on the type of library and specialist librarian, from academic libraries to public libraries, as well as the functions needed behind the scenes to maintain the collection and make it available to its users. The Great Library of Alexandria, created by Ptolemy I after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, was created to house the entirety of Greek literature. It was notable for its famous librarians: Demetrius, Zenodotus, Eratosthenes, Apollonius, Aristophanes, Aristarchus, and Callimachus. These scholars contributed significantly to the collection and cataloging of the wide variety of scrolls in the library's collection. Most notably, Callimachus created what is considered to be the first subject catalogue of the library holdings, called the pinakes. The pinakes contained 120 scrolls arranged into ten subject classes; each class was then subdivided, listing authors alphabetically by titles. The librarians at Alexandria were considered the \"custodians of learning\". As the crisis escalated,  was a high demand for contact tracers, and the CDC had earlier named librarians as key public health staff to support COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing, so many librarians and library staff volunteered to help with contact tracing. Librarians also supported their community in other ways  such as staffing non-emergency hotlines and manning shelters for the homeless, for which they were able to retain their income, while others were furloughed for a time. Additional responsibilities Experienced librarians may take administrative positions such as library or information center director or learning resource officer. Similar to the management of any URLanization, they are concerned with the long-term planning of the library, and its relationship with its URLanization (the city or county for a public library, the college\/university for an academic library, or URLanization served by a special library). In smaller or specialized libraries, librarians typically perform a wide range of the different duties. upJustin Winsor, Librarian of Congress, c. 1885 Representative examples of librarian responsibilities: Researching topics of interest for their constituencies. Referring patrons to other URLanizations and government offices. Suggesting appropriate books (\"readers' advisory\") for children of different reading levels, and recommending novels for recreational reading. Reviewing books and journal databases Working with other URLanisations to establish continual, lifelong learning and further education initiatives Facilitating and promoting reading clubs. Developing programs for library users of all ages and backgrounds. Managing access to electronic information resources. Assessing library services and collections in order to best meet library users' needs.

Some Bayesians have even suggested that the regular notion of belief should be abandoned. But there are also proposals to connect the two, for example, the Lockean thesis, which defines belief as credence above a certain threshold. Justification plays a central role in traditional epistemology while Bayesians have focused on the related notions of confirmation and disconfirmation through evidence. The notion of evidence is important for both approaches but only the traditional approach has been interested in studying the sources of evidence, like perception and memory. Bayesianism, on the other hand, has focused on the role of evidence for rationality: how someone's credence should be adjusted upon receiving new evidence.

{"doc_id":29305513.0,"context":"Legacy of nationalization of history Nation mythologies, histories and states An ancient Finnish Hero Illustration from Kalevala One of the most important consequences of printed texts of nationalized history was that it provided a basis for national revivals in the process of creating modern nations. Projects of national awakenings captured nationalized history and turned it into a weapon of popularization of national myths in the period of establishing history as a social scientific discipline. A shortcut to production of national mythologies that proves ancient origins of modern nations, providing them with a respectable past, was URLery of historical documents, literature and historical works that were lost for some time, and then suddenly rediscovered to the approval of an astonished grateful public. Authors of such rediscovered treasures that were in a quest for success and glory did not suspect that they were in fact builders of as yet nonexistent modern nations. Even when it was obvious that certain texts were basically invented national myths, many social groups, and even intellectuals, wanted to believe that they were authentic national epics, like the Kalevala in Finland. The nationalization of history, which had its origins more in the epics and tendentious oratory than in philosophy, sometimes grew the idea of an esprit des peuples or national spirit , and , later still , the idea that each nation had a 'mission'. Such ideas did not evolve into groups of associated individuals, but into universal spirits that is said to be able to destroy individuals and nations. Nationalization of history was an important element of national revival and creating new nation states in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. New nation states and their institutions had the most important role in social process of the professionalization and institutionalization of history that was additionally supporting the process of nationalization of history. The final consequence was that national history regarded the nation-state as the primary unit of historical analysis. Society and nature 250px|State entities on the former territory of Yugoslavia, 2008. Nationalization of history affects all aspects of life, from relationships with other nationalities to architecture. This is a result of the fact that nationalization of history corresponds with nationalization of nature , and the fact that reservations and hostilities toward other nations accompanied nationalism from the beginning. At the end of the 20th century there were extreme nationalistic interpretations of Balkan and Caucasus history, which became powerful weapons in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.Pakier, Strth; p. 39, \"In the Balkan and Caucasian parts of Europe, history in extreme nationalistic interpretations developed into powerful weapon in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multi-national states like Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.\" After disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, besides the process of renationalization of history, there is sometimes also retroactive nationalization of victims or tragedies of the people that in past lived in those states. According to new national historical narratives, the reason for some people were the victims of certain tragedies was because they were of a certain nationality, for example the Ukrainians of the Soviet Union.Zhurzhenko, The geopolitics of memory, \" An important consequence of the delegitimization of the Soviet historical narrative and the (re-)construction of national histories after 1991 is the retroactive nationalization of victims.... According to the new national historical narrative, they were killed by the Soviet regime because they were Ukrainians  \" Nationalist discourse in Croatia presents the aftermath of Bleiburg repatriations as an event where only Croatians suffered and died just because they were Croatians , eluding the fact that many of the victims were Serbs, Montenegrins or Slovenians while many Croatians had died while fighting as collaborators against Yugoslav partisans. Denationalization of history Nationalization of history has been increasingly called into question, and one of its consequences is the emerging of processes of denationalization of history, which is the result of an intention to change the perspective of creating works about history by promoting pluralism and international standards in social sciences. In Central and Eastern Europe there are tensions between nationalization of history and the process of European integrations.

The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States .

Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  .

The British government and the East India Company were initially worried about the potential liability of this new outpost, but that was soon overshadowed by Singapore's rapid growth as an important trading post.

{"doc_id":29305513.0,"context":"Legacy of nationalization of history Nation mythologies, histories and states An ancient Finnish Hero Illustration from Kalevala One of the most important consequences of printed texts of nationalized history was that it provided a basis for national revivals in the process of creating modern nations. Projects of national awakenings captured nationalized history and turned it into a weapon of popularization of national myths in the period of establishing history as a social scientific discipline. A shortcut to production of national mythologies that proves ancient origins of modern nations, providing them with a respectable past, was URLery of historical documents, literature and historical works that were lost for some time, and then suddenly rediscovered to the approval of an astonished grateful public. Authors of such rediscovered treasures that were in a quest for success and glory did not suspect that they were in fact builders of as yet nonexistent modern nations. Even when it was obvious that certain texts were basically invented national myths, many social groups, and even intellectuals, wanted to believe that they were authentic national epics, like the Kalevala in Finland. The nationalization of history, which had its origins more in the epics and tendentious oratory than in philosophy, sometimes grew the idea of an esprit des peuples or national spirit , and , later still , the idea that each nation had a 'mission'. Such ideas did not evolve into groups of associated individuals, but into universal spirits that is said to be able to destroy individuals and nations. Nationalization of history was an important element of national revival and creating new nation states in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. New nation states and their institutions had the most important role in social process of the professionalization and institutionalization of history that was additionally supporting the process of nationalization of history. The final consequence was that national history regarded the nation-state as the primary unit of historical analysis. Society and nature 250px|State entities on the former territory of Yugoslavia, 2008. Nationalization of history affects all aspects of life, from relationships with other nationalities to architecture. This is a result of the fact that nationalization of history corresponds with nationalization of nature , and the fact that reservations and hostilities toward other nations accompanied nationalism from the beginning. At the end of the 20th century there were extreme nationalistic interpretations of Balkan and Caucasus history, which became powerful weapons in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.Pakier, Strth; p. 39, \"In the Balkan and Caucasian parts of Europe, history in extreme nationalistic interpretations developed into powerful weapon in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multi-national states like Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.\" After disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, besides the process of renationalization of history, there is sometimes also retroactive nationalization of victims or tragedies of the people that in past lived in those states. According to new national historical narratives, the reason for some people were the victims of certain tragedies was because they were of a certain nationality, for example the Ukrainians of the Soviet Union.Zhurzhenko, The geopolitics of memory, \" An important consequence of the delegitimization of the Soviet historical narrative and the (re-)construction of national histories after 1991 is the retroactive nationalization of victims.... According to the new national historical narrative, they were killed by the Soviet regime because they were Ukrainians  \" Nationalist discourse in Croatia presents the aftermath of Bleiburg repatriations as an event where only Croatians suffered and died just because they were Croatians , eluding the fact that many of the victims were Serbs, Montenegrins or Slovenians while many Croatians had died while fighting as collaborators against Yugoslav partisans. Denationalization of history Nationalization of history has been increasingly called into question, and one of its consequences is the emerging of processes of denationalization of history, which is the result of an intention to change the perspective of creating works about history by promoting pluralism and international standards in social sciences. In Central and Eastern Europe there are tensions between nationalization of history and the process of European integrations. That is one of reasons URLanized activities aimed toward denationalization of history. In cases when history was reinterpreted and filtered by the media and official orthodoxy  there is a situation in which  nationalization of history leads to its denial.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" The nationalization of history, which had its origins more in the epics and tendentious oratory than in philosophy, sometimes grew the idea of an esprit des peuples or national spirit , and , later still , the idea that each nation had a 'mission'.","after_edit":" The nationalization of history, which had its origins more in the epics and tendentious oratory than in philosophy, sometimes grew the idea of an esprit des peuples or national spirit and later still the idea that each nation had a 'mission'.","label":"coherence","raw_intents":["fluency","coherence","coherence"]}

Technological developments that affected the course of metal production were only feasible within a stable political environment, and this was not the case until the 9th century (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, a). During the first medieval centuries, the output of metal was in a steady decline and constraint in small scale activities. Miners adopted methods much less efficient than those of the Roman times. Ores were extracted only from shallow depths or from remnants of former abandoned mines. The vicinity of the mine to villages or towns was also a determinant factor when deciding about working on site , because of the high cost of material transportation (Martinon-Torres & Rehren in press, b). Apparently only the output of iron diminished less in relation to the other base and precious metals until the 8th century. This fact, correlated with the dramatic decrease in copper production, may indicate a possible displacement of copper and bronze artifacts by iron ones (Forbes 1957, 64; Bayley et al. 2008, 50).

Lactate is then produced from the pyruvate faster than the body can process it, causing lactate concentrations to rise. Lactate is the end product of glycolysis and increased circulating levels of lactate are associated with increased muscle glycogen breakdown with exercise. Circulating lactate levels have been found higher in heat-sensitive patients with variants in genes encoding the skeletal muscle calcium release channel, as compared to asymptomatic carriers of the same variants. The production of lactate is beneficial for NAD+ regeneration (pyruvate is reduced to lactate while NADH is oxidized to NAD+), which is used up in oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate during production of pyruvate from glucose, and this ensures that energy production is maintained and exercise can continue. During intense exercise, the respiratory chain cannot keep up with the amount of hydrogen ions that join to form NADH, and cannot regenerate NAD+ quickly enough. Lactate served as a metabolic fuel being produced and oxidatively disposed in resting and exercising muscle.  In 2004, Robergs et al. maintained that lactic acidosis during exercise is a \"construct\" or myth, pointing out that part of the H+ comes from ATP hydrolysis (ATP4 + H2O ADP3 + + H+), and that reducing pyruvate to lactate (pyruvate + NADH + H+ lactate + NAD+) actually consumes H+. Lindinger et al. countered that they had ignored the causative factors of the increase in [H+]. After all, the production of lactate from a neutral molecule must increase [H+] to maintain electroneutrality. The point of Robergs's paper, however, was that lactate is produced from pyruvate, which has the same charge. It is pyruvate production from neutral glucose that generates H+: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Subsequent lactate production absorbs these protons: 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH 2 + 2NAD+ Overall: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O 2 + 2NAD+ + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Although the reaction glucose 2lactate + 2H+ releases two H+ when viewed on its own, the H+ are absorbed in the production of ATP. On the other hand, the absorbed acidity is released during subsequent hydrolysis of ATP: ATP4 + H2O ADP3 + + H+. So once the use of ATP is included, the overall reaction is C6H12O6 2 + 2H+","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"Exercise and lactate During power exercises such as sprinting, when the rate of demand for energy is high, glucose is broken down and oxidized to pyruvate .

Iron Age II A pot, discovered in the Iron Age building at Bidaa bint Saud and on display at the Al Ain National Museum. It is thought to be an incense burner. Extensive evidence of Iron Age II settlement has been found throughout the UAE, particularly at Muwailah, Al Thuqeibah, Bidaa bint Saud, as well as Rumailah and Qattara in Al Ain. The development of increasingly complex irrigation ditches and waterways, falaj (plural aflaj) took place during this time and finds at Bidaa bint Saud and Thuqeibah date back to the Iron Age II period pre-dating finds of qanat waterways in Iran. Early finds of aflaj, particularly those around the desert city of Al Ain, have been cited as the earliest evidence of the construction of these waterways. It is thought nearby Bidaa bint Saud became an important site during the Iron Age, both as a caravan stop and as a settled community of farmers that used the falaj irrigation system there. Two of these irrigation passages have been partly excavated at Bidaa bint Saud, with a number of sections remaining in reasonable condition. In one of the excavations, a number of sandstone-lined shaft holes were discovered, as well as a stepped underground access point and a large open cistern. Evidence of formerly irrigated land has also been found at the site. Iron age aflaj Recent finds of pottery in Thuqeibah and Madam have further linked the development of early aflaj ( or qanat ) water systems there to an Iron Age II date, further substantiating the attribution of the innovation of these water systems to a southeastern Arabian origin based on the extensive archaeological work of Dr Wasim Takriti around the area of Al Ain. The 2002 publication of a paper by Tikriti, The south-east Arabian origin of the falaj system, provided the first counterpoint to the long-accepted narrative, that the Qanat originated in Persia and was identified as such by accounts of the campaigns of the Assyrian King, Sargon II, in 714 BCE. Tikriti cites this and also accounts by the Greek second and third century historian Polybius as being the basis for academic attribution of the technology to Persia. He notes academics such as JC Wilkinson (1977) adopting an Iranian origin for the technology under the influence of Sargon's annals and Polybius, but points out at least seven Iron Age aflaj (plural for falaj, the word used to denote waterways of this type in the United Arab Emirates) recently discovered in the Al Ain area of the UAE have been reliably carbon dated back to the beginning of the first millennium BCE. Additional to finds of Iron Age aflaj in Al Ain, Tikrit pointed to excavations in Al Madam, Sharjah, by the French archaeological team working there, as well as by a German team working in Maysar, in Oman. Tikriti is at pains to point out that, despite long-standing efforts since the 19th century to excavate qanat systems in Iran, no evidence has been found for any such qanat there dated earlier than the 5th century BCE. He concludes that the technology originated in South East Arabia and was likely taken to Persia, likely by the Sasanian conquest of the Oman peninsular. Others have followed Tikriti's lead. In 2016, Rmy Boucharlat in his paper Qant and Falaj: Polycentric and Multi-Period Innovations Iran and the United Arab Emirates as Case Studies, asserted that the attribution of the technology to Iranians in the early first millennium BCE is a position that cannot longer be maintained .

{"doc_id":14920509.0,"context":"Markov's principle, named after Andrey Markov Jr, is a statement in computability theory that  is logical validity classically  not in intuitionistic constructive mathematics. Many particular instances of the principle are nevertheless provable there as well. There are many equivalent formulations of Markov's principle, as listed below. In computability theory In the language of computability theory, Markov's principle is a formal expression of the claim that if it is impossible that an algorithm does not terminate, then it does terminate. This is equivalent to the claim that if a set and its complement are both computably enumerable, then the set is decidable.   In constructive analysis It is equivalent, in the language of real analysis, to the following principles: Realizability If constructive arithmetic is translated using realizability into a classical meta-theory that proves the -consistency of the relevant classical theory (for example, Peano Arithmetic if we are studying Heyting arithmetic), then Markov's principle is justified: a realizer is the constant function that takes a realization that is not everywhere false to the unbounded search that successively checks if is true. If is not everywhere false, then by -consistency there must be a term for which holds, and each term will be checked by the search eventually. If however does not hold anywhere, then the domain of the constant function must be empty, so although the search does not halt it still holds vacuously that the function is a realizer. By the Law of the Excluded Middle (in our classical metatheory), must either hold nowhere or not hold nowhere, therefore this constant function is a realizer. If instead the realizability interpretation is used in a constructive meta-theory, then it is not justified. Indeed, for first-order arithmetic, Markov's principle exactly captures the difference between a constructive and classical meta-theory. Specifically, a statement is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Heyting arithmetic; and it is provable in Heyting arithmetic with Extended Church's thesis and Markov's principle if and only if there is a number that provably realizes it in Peano arithmetic .","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" There are many equivalent formulations of Markov's principle, as listed below.","after_edit":" ","label":"coherence","raw_intents":["clarity","coherence","coherence"]}
{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written.

{"doc_id":250641.0,"context":"The role of the librarian has changed much over time, with the past century in particular bringing many new media and technologies into play. From the earliest libraries in the ancient world to the modern information hub, there have been keepers and disseminators of the information held in data stores. Roles and responsibilities vary widely depending on the type of library and specialist librarian, from academic libraries to public libraries, as well as the functions needed behind the scenes to maintain the collection and make it available to its users. The Great Library of Alexandria, created by Ptolemy I after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, was created to house the entirety of Greek literature. It was notable for its famous librarians: Demetrius, Zenodotus, Eratosthenes, Apollonius, Aristophanes, Aristarchus, and Callimachus. These scholars contributed significantly to the collection and cataloging of the wide variety of scrolls in the library's collection. Most notably, Callimachus created what is considered to be the first subject catalogue of the library holdings, called the pinakes. The pinakes contained 120 scrolls arranged into ten subject classes; each class was then subdivided, listing authors alphabetically by titles. The librarians at Alexandria were considered the \"custodians of learning\". As the crisis escalated,  was a high demand for contact tracers, and the CDC had earlier named librarians as key public health staff to support COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing, so many librarians and library staff volunteered to help with contact tracing. Librarians also supported their community in other ways  such as staffing non-emergency hotlines and manning shelters for the homeless, for which they were able to retain their income, while others were furloughed for a time. Additional responsibilities Experienced librarians may take administrative positions such as library or information center director or learning resource officer. Similar to the management of any URLanization, they are concerned with the long-term planning of the library, and its relationship with its URLanization (the city or county for a public library, the college\/university for an academic library, or URLanization served by a special library). In smaller or specialized libraries, librarians typically perform a wide range of the different duties. upJustin Winsor, Librarian of Congress, c. 1885 Representative examples of librarian responsibilities: Researching topics of interest for their constituencies. Referring patrons to other URLanizations and government offices. Suggesting appropriate books (\"readers' advisory\") for children of different reading levels, and recommending novels for recreational reading. Reviewing books and journal databases Working with other URLanisations to establish continual, lifelong learning and further education initiatives Facilitating and promoting reading clubs. Developing programs for library users of all ages and backgrounds. Managing access to electronic information resources. Assessing library services and collections in order to best meet library users' needs. Building and maintaining collections to respond to changing community needs or demands Creating pathfinders Writing grants to gain funding for expanded program or collections Digitizing collections for online access Publishing articles in library science journals Answering incoming reference questions via telephone, postal mail, email, fax, and chat delivering arts and cultural activities to local communities Initiating and establishing creative digital activities to introduce children to coding, engineering and website building Marking promotion and advocacy of library services Assisting job seekers and local businesses Making and enforcing computer appointments on the public access Internet computers.\"The librarian's Internet survival guide: strategies for the high-tech reference desk\", Irene E.

They can be highly specialized, serving a discrete user group with a restricted collection area.

Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I.

The main gate of the Nyumba ya Sanaa cultural centre in Dar es Salaam has decorations by Lilanga URLe Lilanga (right) and fellow painter Patrick Francis Imanjama outside Nyumba ya Sanaa In 1970, Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures and practising contemporary art. In 1971, he found his first employment, thanks to his uncle, Augustino Malaba, an already well-known sculptor, who would be his future collaborator. He worked as a night guard at the House of Art (Nyumba ya Sanaa), a  centre for the development of African art and craftsmanship in Dar es Salaam. Lilanga's talents were soon recognized by Jean Pruitt, an American aid worker promoting Tanzanian art. Lilanga welcomed  other artists like Robino Ntila, Augustino Malaba and Patrick Francis Imanjama to join Nyumba ya Sanaa . He also began to create paintings on batik cloth, on goatskin and on metal sheets for the finishing of railings and gates of the centre.  In 1977, he made his first journey outside Africa, travelling to New York, where he had a show at the Maryknoll Sisters Ossining Center . He stayed for a brief time in Manhattan, selling prints made on paper or cardboard, standing on street corners. Artistic development & success Shortly after beginning grammar school, Lilanga had his first contact with sculpture ( roots, softwood and, later, hard ebony), working in the Makonde tradition. He dedicated himself almost exclusively to this technique from 1961 until 1972. He showed his first works to Europeans who worked in the refugee camps during Mozambique's war of independence. Following their advice, in 1970 Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures. A lot of URLe Lilanga's lifetime art works can be found in leading international collections like The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi or the Hamburg Mawingu Collection HMC of German collector Peter-Andreas Kamphausen. Directly after the death of the artist, the HMC: URLe Lilanga Collection presented the first systematically and thematically complete catalogue of Lilanga's work. In addition, the book explores the traditional roots of East African Makonde art, as well as four decades of Lilanga's artistic development with different materials and techniques, including sculpture, paintings, etchings, drawings and metal works. Currently the HMC publish the URLe Lilanga News as an online blog with information about the artist, his art works, exhibitions and other interesting background material.

The lateral system of succession may or may not exclude male descendants in the female line from succession.

A drawback of the lateral succession is that, while ensuring a most competent leadership for the moment, the system inherently created derelict prince lines not eligible for succession. Any scion of an eligible heir that did not live long enough to ascend to the throne was cast aside as not eligible, creating a pool of discontented pretenders called Tegin in Turkic and Izgoi in Rus dynastic lines.

{"doc_id":51488038.0,"context":"The vulture and the little girl, also known as \"The Struggling Girl\", is a famous photograph by Kevin Carter which first appeared in The New York Times on 26 March 1993. It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a hooded vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan (now South Sudan), in March 1993, and to have survived the incident. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. Carter took his own life four months after winning the prize. Background The Hunger Triangle, a name URLanisations used in the 1990s for the area defined by the southern Sudan communities Kongor, Ayod, and Waat, was dependent on UNESCO and other URLanisations to fight famine. Forty percent of the area's children under 5 years old were malnourished as of January 1993, and an estimated 10 to 13 adults died of starvation daily in Ayod alone. To raise awareness of the situation, Operation Lifeline Sudan invited photojournalists and others, previously excluded from entering the country, to report on conditions. In March 1993, the government began granting visas to journalists for a 24-hour stay with severe restrictions on their travel within the country, including government supervision at all times. Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan. It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva saw this as a chance to work more as a war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested in going. According to fellow war photographer Greg Marinovich, Carter saw the trip as an opportunity to fix some problems \"he felt trapped in\". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\". To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have \"great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan pancake\", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: \"The UN hoped to publish the famine Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for URLanisations to sustain funding\". About the political differences and fighting \"Joo and Kevin knew none of this they just wanted to get in and shoot pictures\". Waiting in Nairobi Silva and Carter had prepared carefully for the trip. They stopped in Nairobi on their way to Sudan. The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region . But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod. In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards. The residents of the hamlet have been looked after by the UN aid station for some time. Greg Marinovich and Joo Silva described that in the book The Bang Bang Club, Chapter 10 \"Flies and Hungry People\". The child was already cared for before Kevin Carter and Joo Silva landed there and Carter took his famous picture. Marinovich wrote that the villagers were already waiting next to the runway to get the food as quickly as possible: \"Mothers who had joined the throng waiting for food left their children on the sandy ground nearby.\" Silva and Carter separated to take pictures of both children and adults, both the living and dead, all victims of the catastrophic famine that had arisen through the war. Carter went several times to Silva to tell him about the shocking situation he had just photographed. Witnessing the famine affected him emotionally. Silva was searching for rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority and when he found some soldiers Carter joined him. The soldiers did not speak English, but one was interested in Carter's watch. Carter gave him his cheap wristwatch as a gift. The soldiers became their bodyguards and followed them for their protection. To stay a week with the rebels they needed the permission of a rebel commander. Their plane was due to depart in an hour and without the permission to stay they would be forced to fly out. Again they separated and Silva went to the clinic complex to ask for the rebel commander and he was told the commander was in Kongor, South Sudan. This was good news for Silva, as \"their little UN plane was heading there next\". He left the clinic and went back to the runway, taking pictures of children and adults on his way. He came across a child lying on his face in the hot sun he took a picture. In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of \"fevers\", according to his family.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards.","after_edit":" In Ayod The next day , their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards.","label":"fluency","raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"]}

The agreement was negotiated and concluded in Brussels under the auspices of the European Union and signed on 19 April 2013. Negotiations were led by Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Da\u010di\u0107 and Kosovo Prime Minister Hashim Tha\u00e7i and mediated by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton. The government of Serbia does not recognize Kosovo as a sovereign state, but began normalizing relations with the government of Kosovo nonetheless, in accordance with the Brussels URL In 2018, Serbia's president Aleksandar Vucic commented that the agreement is a difficult compromise for Serbia, which according to him fulfilled all of its obligations. Background Following the Kosovo War and NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999, Kosovo, as part of Serbia and Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, was placed under United Nations administration under UNSC Resolution 1244. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence and has since been recognized by 98 countries. However, Serbia maintains that Kosovo continues to be its territory. Kosovo has become a member of several international organizations, while according to Serbia and about half of the UN member states, Resolution 1244 remains legally binding on all parties.

Baroness Ashton, the EU High Representative, had been chairing talks for two years, followed by Federica Mogherini. Normalization of relations with neighboring states is a key precondition for states wishing to join the EU; the Brussels Agreement brought Serbia close to EU accession talks and Kosovo to initialing a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA). The SAA was signed by HR Mogherini and PM Mustafa in October 2015.

U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton invited Baroness Ashton to undertake joint travel in the Balkans, and the two made joint visits to Belgrade and Pristina (as well as Sarajevo) in October 2012. Clinton assigned Deputy Assistant Secretary of State ambassador Philip Reeker to support Ashton's efforts. Reeker and his team coordinated closely with EU colleagues and met with Serbian and Kosovar representatives on the margins of every dialogue session in Brussels, and during visits to the region. The result was the 15-point \"First Agreement of Principles Governing the Normalisation of Relations\", initialed but not signed on 19 April 2013.

Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I.

In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I.

The slender design of the tube which contained the rocket's payload  was very narrow and long, limiting what objects could be inserted into the tube. This limitation on size was extremely inconvenient when considering the future proposed payloads of Martlet rockets which included satellites and space probes. The cannon-like design also eliminated the capacity for crewed space travel as well as the launching of satellites carrying extremely sensitive scientific instruments and payloads due to the extreme acceleration placed on the projectile during firing.

Marlet 2A was designed simultaneously with the Martlet 1 with a range of interest being 70 to 200 kilometers.

Despite similarities in missile air frame , the Martlet 2A, 2B, and 2C featured differences in their structural materials and mechanical details. For the Martlet 2A, the liquid payload was loaded into an aluminum, tapered liner inside the missile body.

Nkwenkwe continued to preach despite the terms of her release, and she was re-arrested in April 1923. The arrest of Nkwenkwe enraged her supporters. In a show of solidarity, hundreds of her supporters gathered, ready to engage the authorities in the event that she was charged. Mindful of the disorder that could be unleashed by a possible court appearance, the authorities committed Nontetha to Fort Beaufort Mental Hospital.

{"doc_id":51488038.0,"context":"The vulture and the little girl, also known as \"The Struggling Girl\", is a famous photograph by Kevin Carter which first appeared in The New York Times on 26 March 1993. It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a hooded vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan (now South Sudan), in March 1993, and to have survived the incident. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. Carter took his own life four months after winning the prize. Background The Hunger Triangle, a name URLanisations used in the 1990s for the area defined by the southern Sudan communities Kongor, Ayod, and Waat, was dependent on UNESCO and other URLanisations to fight famine. Forty percent of the area's children under 5 years old were malnourished as of January 1993, and an estimated 10 to 13 adults died of starvation daily in Ayod alone. To raise awareness of the situation, Operation Lifeline Sudan invited photojournalists and others, previously excluded from entering the country, to report on conditions. In March 1993, the government began granting visas to journalists for a 24-hour stay with severe restrictions on their travel within the country, including government supervision at all times. Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan. It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva saw this as a chance to work more as a war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested in going. According to fellow war photographer Greg Marinovich, Carter saw the trip as an opportunity to fix some problems \"he felt trapped in\". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\". To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have \"great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan pancake\", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: \"The UN hoped to publish the famine Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for URLanisations to sustain funding\". About the political differences and fighting \"Joo and Kevin knew none of this they just wanted to get in and shoot pictures\". Waiting in Nairobi Silva and Carter had prepared carefully for the trip. They stopped in Nairobi on their way to Sudan. The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region . But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod. In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards. The residents of the hamlet have been looked after by the UN aid station for some time. Greg Marinovich and Joo Silva described that in the book The Bang Bang Club, Chapter 10 \"Flies and Hungry People\". The child was already cared for before Kevin Carter and Joo Silva landed there and Carter took his famous picture. Marinovich wrote that the villagers were already waiting next to the runway to get the food as quickly as possible: \"Mothers who had joined the throng waiting for food left their children on the sandy ground nearby.\" Silva and Carter separated to take pictures of both children and adults, both the living and dead, all victims of the catastrophic famine that had arisen through the war. Carter went several times to Silva to tell him about the shocking situation he had just photographed. Witnessing the famine affected him emotionally. Silva was searching for rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority and when he found some soldiers Carter joined him. The soldiers did not speak English, but one was interested in Carter's watch. Carter gave him his cheap wristwatch as a gift. The soldiers became their bodyguards and followed them for their protection. To stay a week with the rebels they needed the permission of a rebel commander. Their plane was due to depart in an hour and without the permission to stay they would be forced to fly out. Again they separated and Silva went to the clinic complex to ask for the rebel commander and he was told the commander was in Kongor, South Sudan. This was good news for Silva, as \"their little UN plane was heading there next\". He left the clinic and went back to the runway, taking pictures of children and adults on his way. He came across a child lying on his face in the hot sun he took a picture. In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of \"fevers\", according to his family.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too.","after_edit":" To pay for the travel , Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too.","label":"fluency","raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"]}

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective.","after_edit":" What gives this concept of \"academic history\" its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective.","label":"fluency","raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"]}

{"doc_id":18309949.0,"context":"A discordant system or pattern does not correlate to the topography and geology of the area. Discordant drainage patterns are classified into two main types: antecedent and superimposed, while anteposition drainage patterns combine the two. In antecedent drainage, a river's vertical incision ability matches that of land uplift due to tectonic forces. Superimposed drainage develops differently: initially, a drainage system develops on a surface composed of 'younger' rocks, but due to denudative activities this surface of younger rocks is removed and the river continues to flow over a seemingly new surface, but one in fact made up of rocks of old geological formation. Dendritic drainage patterns Dendritic drainage pattern Dendritic drainage systems (from Greek , dendrites, \"of or like a tree\") are not straight and are the most common form of  drainage system. In this, there are many sub-tributaries (analogous to the twigs of a tree), which merge into tributaries of the main river (the branches and the trunk of the tree, respectively). They are seen to feed a river channel that matches and is strongly accordant to the overriding gradient of the land. Truly dendritic systems form in V-shaped valleys; as a result, the rock types must be quite  impervious and non-porous. Trellis drainage pattern The geometry of a trellis drainage system is similar to that of a common garden trellis. Along a strike valley, smaller tributaries feed into from the steep slopes of mountain sides . These tributaries enter the main river about perpendicular, causing a trellis-like appearance of the system. They form where hard and soft formations exist on both banks of the main river, and are reflective of height, accentuated by erosion. Trellis drainage is characteristic of folded mountains, such as the Appalachian Mountains in North America and in the north part of Trinidad.Ritter, Michael E., The Physical Environment: an Introduction to Physical Geography. 2006 Rectangular drainage pattern Rectangular drainage develops on rocks that are of approximately uniform resistance to erosion, but which have two directions of jointing at approximately right angles or 90 degrees. The joints are usually less resistant to erosion than the bulk rock so erosion tends to preferentially open the joints and streams eventually develop along the joints. The result is a stream system in which streams consist mainly of straight line segments with right angle bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles. This pattern can be found with the Arun River in Nepal.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" The result is a stream system in which streams consist mainly of straight line segments with right angle bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles.","after_edit":" The result is a stream system in which streams consist mainly of straight line segments with right-angle bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles.","label":"fluency","raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"]}

A discovery driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements: Definition of success for the plan or initiative, including a 'reverse' income statement Benchmarking against market and competitive parameters Specification of operational requirements Documentation of assumptions Specification of key checkpoints Using discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost. The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered 'real' options.

Civil libertarianism is not limited to an individual ideology, rather, it is a philosophy based on a strict interpretation of the Constitution's civil liberties and the many civil rightslaws enacted since . In the libertarian movement The primary concern of most Civil Libertarians is the government's reach over the individual. In theory, the civil libertarian seeks to reduce the role of government to a minimum - preferring private businesses to fill the many social needs for most Americans. Under the control of elected officials, the government is only relied upon for regulation, without excessively interfering in the lives of its citizens. The Civil Libertarian sees the government's role as critical - supporting free enterprise and the privatization of government programs wherever improvements are possible. One of the central pillars of Civil Libertarianism is free speech. In many cases Civil Libertarians oppose bans on hate speech and obscenity. Although they may or may not personally condone behaviors associated with these issues, civil libertarians hold that the advantages of unfettered public discourse outweigh all disadvantages.

{"doc_id":6970425.0,"context":"Lateral succession Lateral or fraternal system of succession mandates principles of seniority among members of a dynasty or dynastic clan, with a purpose of election a best qualified candidate for the leadership. The leaders are elected as being the most mature elders of the clan, already in possession of military power and competence. Fraternal succession is preferred to ensure that mature leaders are in charge, removing a need for regents. The lateral system of succession may or may not exclude male descendants in the female line from succession. In practice, when no male heir is mature enough, a female heir is usually determined \"pragmatically\", by proximity to the last monarch, like Boariks of the Caucasian Huns or Tamiris of Massagetes in Middle Asia  . The lateral monarch is generally elected after the leadership throne becomes vacant. In the early years of the Mongol empire, the death of the ruling monarchs, Genghis Khan and gedei Khan, immediately stopped the Mongol western campaigns because of the upcoming elections. A drawback of the lateral succession is that, while ensuring a most competent leadership for the moment, the system inherently created derelict prince lines not eligible for succession. Any scion of an eligible heir that did not live long enough to ascend to the throne was cast aside as not eligible, creating a pool of discontented pretenders called Tegin in Turkic and Izgoi in Rus dynastic lines. The unsettled pool of derelict princes would eventually bring havoc to the succession order and dismemberment to the state.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Any scion of an eligible heir that did not live long enough to ascend to the throne was cast aside as not eligible, creating a pool of discontented pretenders called Tegin in Turkic and Izgoi in Rus dynastic lines.","after_edit":" Any scion of an eligible heir who did not live long enough to ascend to the throne was cast aside as not eligible, creating a pool of discontented pretenders called Tegin in Turkic and Izgoi in Rus dynastic lines.","label":"fluency","raw_intents":["fluency","fluency","fluency"]}

Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution, pg. 123. also spelled Malecite), are an Algonquian-speaking First Nation of the Wabanaki Confederacy. They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States . Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland . Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. Wlastkw means \"Beautiful River.\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. Wlastkwewiyik means \"People of the Beautiful River,\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007. Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years. Despite devastating population losses to European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, these Atlantic First Nations held on to their traditional coastal or river locations for hunting, fishing and gathering , and were concentrated along river valleys for trapping.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans.","after_edit":" The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\" .

{"doc_id":1214033.0,"context":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written. The time period was subdivided into eras and one volume specified for each. Within each volume there would be a fixed number of topics. Either each volume would either be written by one historian on the faculty, or else each topic would be handled by a faculty member throughout the series of volumes, or perhaps another system of specialization would be prescribed. This procedure was similar to that undertaken on such campuses to produce encyclopedias of natural history, such as marine biology, for which different scholars would write about different phyla. Examples of the end result of this procedure include the series done by Cambridge on Greco-Roman history, and that of Oxford on British history, which may be found on the reserve stacks of many public libraries in the 21st century. What gives this concept of 'academic history' its own historicity, or \"cubbyhole in time\", superseded by progress, is that an academic history was intended to be definitive even though its subject matter, unlike the marine biology mentioned above, was not objective. When the volume on the Regency was published, for example, some may have thought that such would be the complete history of that era, and no one would need to do as much work in that field, because the best people with the best resources would already have written it down. Subsequent changes in scholarly perspective can alter that perception; for example the work of Lewis Namier on mid-18th century British politics caused one of the Oxford History volumes to appear outdated. It was not considered that entirely new viewpoints and methods would come into being, or that scholars would follow new threads of causality throughout stretches of time that differed from the canonical ones over a region which varied over time. And as each academic history was primarily a list of persons, places, things, and events, there was hardly any Marxian content to any of these projects. By the second half of the 20th , there weren't any more  academic histories. History is no longer subdivided  in such an assembly-line fashion with such an authoritative result expected. However, the project of globalization has brought with it the notion of writing a history that has no national center. All the projects above, allocated to the faculty of a university, had the viewpoint of their country or region in mind. These new histories are similar to the academic , in that they are large and done by many people by a similar process of allocation, but they do not have the same all-specifying concept of classification; instead, it is interrelation which is of concern.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time  in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written.","after_edit":"In the 19th century , the idea appeared in universities that a definitive history could be written of a major region of the world for a great span of time - in a similar manner to the way that an encyclopediawas written.","label":"fluency","raw_intents":["fluency","coherence","fluency"]}

In 1971, he found his first employment, thanks to his uncle, Augustino Malaba, an already well-known sculptor, who would be his future collaborator. He worked as a night guard at the House of Art (Nyumba ya Sanaa), a  centre for the development of African art and craftsmanship in Dar es Salaam. Lilanga's talents were soon recognized by Jean Pruitt, an American aid worker promoting Tanzanian art. Lilanga welcomed  other artists like Robino Ntila, Augustino Malaba and Patrick Francis Imanjama to join Nyumba ya Sanaa . He also began to create paintings on batik cloth, on goatskin and on metal sheets for the finishing of railings and gates of the centre.  In 1977, he made his first journey outside Africa, travelling to New York, where he had a show at the Maryknoll Sisters Ossining Center . He stayed for a brief time in Manhattan, selling prints made on paper or cardboard, standing on street corners. Artistic development & success Shortly after beginning grammar school, Lilanga had his first contact with sculpture ( roots, softwood and, later, hard ebony), working in the Makonde tradition. He dedicated himself almost exclusively to this technique from 1961 until 1972. He showed his first works to Europeans who worked in the refugee camps during Mozambique's war of independence. Following their advice, in 1970 Lilanga decided to move to Dar es Salaam, where there were greater opportunities for selling sculptures. A lot of URLe Lilanga's lifetime art works can be found in leading international collections like The Contemporary African Art Collection (CAAC) of Jean Pigozzi or the Hamburg Mawingu Collection HMC of German collector Peter-Andreas Kamphausen.

Martlet 3E The Martlet 3E was a suborbital solid rocket designed to be fired from a smaller, 7-inch (180mm) cannon used in the HARP project. Its basic concept revolved around packaging the rocket grain in a case with elastic properties to transmit the lateral strain to the gun tube. The 3E model utilized a new technique of rocket grain construction  that consisted of laminating sheet double-base propellant grain under hydraulic pressure.

Two versions of full-scale orbital launch vehicle projectiles were proposed in the Martlet 4 series. The first was to have used three solid rocket motor stages and was planned to orbit approximately 50 pounds of payload.

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier .

He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her. In several cases, he was unable to explain why he committed the murders: this was the case with Hardy, with whom Benjamin had an intimate relationship, but after doing drugs together, he said he strangled her for no apparent reason.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":"  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991.","after_edit":" He stated that he lured his victims into abandoned houses by offering them drugs and alcohol, in addition to paying for their sexual services.

{"doc_id":55503854.0,"context":"Relation to traditional epistemology Traditional epistemology and Bayesian epistemology are both forms of epistemology, but they differ in various respects, for example, concerning their methodology, the propositional attitudes they study , the role justification or confirmation plays in them and some of their research interests. Bayesian epistemology focuses on degrees of belief, also often called credences. On the other hand, Traditional epistemology focuses on knowledge, analyzed by Plato as being justified true beliefs . They then seek to understand what counts as knowledgeand how to evaluate one's beliefs (see foundationalism, coherentism, and the problem of philosophical skepticism or the question of whether knowledge is possible at all ) . Bayesian epistemology, on the other hand, works by formalizing concepts and problems, which are often vague in the traditional approach. It thereby focuses more on mathematical intuitions and promises a higher degree of precision. It sees belief as a continuous phenomenon that comes in various degrees, so-called credences. Some Bayesians have even suggested that the regular notion of belief should be abandoned. But there are also proposals to connect the two, for example, the Lockean thesis, which defines belief as credence above a certain threshold. Justification plays a central role in traditional epistemology while Bayesians have focused on the related notions of confirmation and disconfirmation through evidence. The notion of evidence is important for both approaches but only the traditional approach has been interested in studying the sources of evidence, like perception and memory. Bayesianism, on the other hand, has focused on the role of evidence for rationality: how someone's credence should be adjusted upon receiving new evidence. There is an analogy between the Bayesian norms of rationality in terms of probabilistic laws and the traditional norms of rationality in terms of deductive consistency. Certain traditional problems, like the topic of skepticism about our knowledge of the external world, are difficult to express in Bayesian terms.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" On the other hand, Traditional epistemology focuses on knowledge, analyzed by Plato as being justified true beliefs .

Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I. C. 1985. Milestones for successful venture planning.

A discovery driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements: Definition of success for the plan or initiative, including a 'reverse' income statement Benchmarking against market and competitive parameters Specification of operational requirements Documentation of assumptions Specification of key checkpoints Using discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost.

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered.

After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her.

{"doc_id":33653387.0,"context":"In this way, Persian became a second language to many across North India;  Alam contends that it neared the status of a first language. By the 18th century, many Indians in the north of the subcontinent had a \"native speaker's competence in Persian\".Faruqi, Shamsur Rahman (2003), \"A Long History of Urdu Literarature, Part 1\", in Pollock (ed.), Literary cultures in history: reconstructions from South Asia, p. 849, Decline Following Aurangzeb's death, Persian began to fall into decline, being displaced by Hindustani (Hindi-Urdu). The arrival and strengthening of British political power added a growing influence of English as well. However, for a long time Persian was still the dominant language of the subcontinent, used in education, Muslim rule, the judiciary, and literature. The East India Company acknowledged Persian as a \"language of command\", necessary to communicate with and control the Indian population. Hence many British officials arriving in India learned Persian in colleges established by the Company. The teachers in these colleges were often Indian. In some cases, Britishers even took over as Persian professors, sidelining the role of the Indians. Deccan A Persian poem produced in the Deccan. 17th century.|346x346px Although considerably distanced from North India, the Deccan was also a recipient of Persian's linguistic impact. Persianate culture was brought to the Deccan fleetingly through the efforts of the Delhi Sultanate in the early 14th century. Persian finally gained a foothold in the region with the establishment of the Bahmani Sultanate in 1347, which used the language for official purposes. The dynasty had a great interest in Persian culture, and several members were proficient in the language, producing their own literature. Literati from Northern India found themselves welcome at the court, and scholars from Iran were invited as well. Madrasas were built over the expanse of the kingdom, most notably the Mahmud Gawan Madrasa at Bidar, where Persian was taught.  In spite of this, Persian did not achieve the linguistic penetration it had in the north of the subcontinent. Richard Eaton writes that Persian was much less widely understood in the  region than vernacular languages  . During the turn of the 16th century, the Bahmani Sultanate splintered into the Deccan Sultanates, which were also Persianate in culture. They used Persian as a courtly language, as well as for official and administrative purposes. The language received literary patronage  . However, the sultans simultaneously promoted regional languages such as Telugu, Marathi, and Deccani (the southern variety of Hindustani), at times even using them in administration.  The reign of the Deccan Sultanates lasted until the late 17th century, when Aurangzeb brought the region into the Mughal Empire and established Aurangabad as the Deccan's capital. As was Mughal practice, Persian was used in many levels of administration. Major cities of this region that served as centres of Persian patronage included Gulbarga, Bidar, Bijapur, and Golconda. Notable Persian literature produced includes Futuh-us-Salatin, and the Bahmannamh . Influence on Indic languages As a prestige language and lingua franca over a period of 800 years in the Indian subcontinent, Classical Persian exerted a vast influence over numerous Indic languages. Generally speaking, the degree of impact is seen to increase the more one moves towards the north-west of the subcontinent, i.e. the Indo-Iranian frontier. For example, the Indo-Aryan languages have the most impact from Persian; this ranges from a high appearance in Punjabi, Sindhi, Kashmiri, and Gujarati, to more moderate representation in Bengali and Marathi. The largest foreign element in the Indo-Aryan languages is Persian. Conversely, the Dravidian languages have seen a low level of influence from Persian. They still feature loans from the language, some of which are direct, and some through Deccani (the southern variety of Hindustani), due to the Islamic rulers of the Deccan. Telugu is a good example of this (see Telangana Baasha for the Telugu dialect accentuated with these features).

However, it still lingers in some scholarly and literary circles; for example, the University of Kashmir in Srinagar has been publishing the Persian-language journal Dnish since 1969. Some colleges and universities in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh offer Persian as a course of study.  Though Arabic largely dominates the realm of Islamic liturgy and theology in the Indian subcontinent, Persian can also be seen in some religious spheres: the dhikr sessions of Sufism often employ Persian poetry in song, and the Sufi devotional music genre of qawwali also uses Persian in parallel with local languages.

{"doc_id":25893514.0,"context":"When breast cancer is surgically excised, it can come back (local recurrence) in the remaining breast or on the chest wall in a small proportion of women. Adjuvant radiotherapy is necessary if breast cancer is treated by removing only the cancerous lump with a rim of surrounding normal tissue, as it reduces the chance of local recurrence significantly . When cancer does come back, it most commonly occurs in the tissues surrounding the original cancer (the tumour bed), even though there are multicentric cancers in remote areas of the breast. This suggests that it is most important to treat the tumour bed. The rationale for TARGIT is to deliver a high dose of radiation precisely to the tumour bed. Conventional radiation techniques such as external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) following surgical removal of the tumour have been time tested and proven to be effective. EBRT is usually given as a course of whole breast radiotherapy and an additional tumour bed boost  . However, it has a few drawbacks; for example, the tumour bed where the boost dose should be applied can be missed (\"geographical miss\") due to the difficulties in localization of the complex wound cavity  even when modern radiotherapy planning is used. Additionally, the usual delay (\"temporal miss\") between the surgical removal of the tumour and EBRT may allow a repopulation of the tumour cells  . These potentially harmful effects can be avoided by delivering the radiation more precisely to the targeted tissues leading to immediate sterilization of residual tumour cells. Furthermore, TARGIT inhibits the stimulating effects of wound fluid on cancer cells, suggesting for the first time, a beneficial effect of intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) on tumour microenvironment. In these studies, women treated with  TARGIT-IORT  during lumpectomy for breast cancer combined with whole breast radiotherapy had a significantly low mortality from non-breast-cancer causes, such as cardiovascular and lung complications, as well as other cancers compared with those who received whole breast radiotherapy. Therefore, this reduction was thought to be due to the delivery of TARGIT-IORT to the fresh tumour bed during the trauma of surgery rather than avoidance of scattered radiation from whole breast radiotherapy .","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In these studies, women treated with  TARGIT-IORT  during lumpectomy for breast cancer combined with whole breast radiotherapy had a significantly low mortality from non-breast-cancer causes, such as cardiovascular and lung complications, as well as other cancers compared with those who received whole breast radiotherapy.

{"doc_id":5467330.0,"context":"Herbert Richard Baumeister (April 7, 1947 July 3, 1996) was an American  suspected serial killer. A resident of the Indianapolis suburb of Westfield, Indiana, he was under investigation for murdering over a dozen men in the early 1990s, most of whom were last seen at gay bars. Police found the remains of eleven persons, eight identified, on Baumeister's property. After an arrest warrant was issued, Baumeister fled to Canada and killed himself before he could be brought to trial. He never confessed to the crimes and his suicide note made no mention of the murder allegations. He was later linked to a series of murders of at least nine men along Interstate 70, which occurred in the early to mid-1980s. Early life  Baumeister was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the oldest of four children born to Herbert and Elizabeth Baumeister. His childhood was reportedly normal . By the onset of adolescence, he began exhibiting anti-social behavior . Acquaintances later recalled the young Baumeister playing with dead animals and urinating on a teacher's desk , which are textbook signs of a burgeoning serial killer . In his teens, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia , but did not receive further psychiatric treatment. In 1965, Baumeister attended Indiana University for a semester before dropping out, but returned in 1967. In 1972, he attended a semester at Butler University. As an adult, he drifted through a series of jobs, marked by a strong work ethic , but also by increasingly bizarre behavior. Baumeister married Juliana \"Julie\" Saiter in November 1971, a union that produced three children. Julie later said they had been sexually intimate only six times in over 25 years of marriage. In the 1970s, Baumeister was committed to a psychiatric hospital by his father . His wife said he was \"hurting and needed help.\" Baumeister founded the successful Sav-A-Lot thrift store chain (two stores total) in Indianapolis in 1988. Investigation By the early 1990s, investigators with the Marion County Sheriff's Department and the Indianapolis Police Department began investigating the disappearances of gay men of similar age, height, and weight in the Indianapolis area. In 1992, they were contacted by a man named Tony Harris claiming that a gay bar patron calling himself \"Brian Smart\" had killed a friend of his, and had attempted to kill him with a pool hose during an erotic asphyxiation session. Harris eventually saw this man again in August 1995, following him and noting a license plate number. From this data, police identified \"Brian Smart\" as Herb Baumeister. Investigators approached Baumeister, told him he was a suspect in the disappearances, and asked to search his house. Both Baumeister and his wife, Julie, refused to allow a search of their house . By June 1996, however, Julie had become sufficiently frightened by her husband's mood swings and erratic behavior that, after filing for divorce, she consented to a search. The search of the estate, Fox Hollow Farm, was conducted while Baumeister was on vacation. It turned up the remains of eleven men, eight of whom were identified. Baumeister would posthumously be suspected of killing nine other men, the bodies of whom were found in rural areas along the corridor of Interstate 70 between Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio  during the early to mid 1980s. One eyewitness identified Baumeister as the man seen leaving a bar in 1983 with Michael Riley, who was later found dead. Like the other victims, Riley was strangled to death and deposited nude or semi-nude in a river.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Early life  Baumeister was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the oldest of four children born to Herbert and Elizabeth Baumeister.","after_edit":" Early life Herbert Baumeister was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the oldest of four children born to Herbert and Elizabeth Baumeister.","label":"meaning-changed","raw_intents":["meaning-changed","meaning-changed","meaning-changed"]}
{"doc_id":51488038.0,"context":"The vulture and the little girl, also known as \"The Struggling Girl\", is a famous photograph by Kevin Carter which first appeared in The New York Times on 26 March 1993. It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a hooded vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan (now South Sudan), in March 1993, and to have survived the incident. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. Carter took his own life four months after winning the prize. Background The Hunger Triangle, a name URLanisations used in the 1990s for the area defined by the southern Sudan communities Kongor, Ayod, and Waat, was dependent on UNESCO and other URLanisations to fight famine. Forty percent of the area's children under 5 years old were malnourished as of January 1993, and an estimated 10 to 13 adults died of starvation daily in Ayod alone. To raise awareness of the situation, Operation Lifeline Sudan invited photojournalists and others, previously excluded from entering the country, to report on conditions. In March 1993, the government began granting visas to journalists for a 24-hour stay with severe restrictions on their travel within the country, including government supervision at all times. Joo Silva and Kevin Carter in Sudan Invitation by UN Operation Lifeline Sudan In March 1993, Robert Hadley, a former photographer and at this time the information officer for the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan, offered Joo Silva and Kevin Carter to come to Sudan and report about the famine in southern Sudan. It was an offer to go into southern Sudan with the rebels. Silva saw this as a chance to work more as a war-photographer in the future. He started the arrangements and secured assignments for the expenses of the travel. Silva told Carter about the offer and Carter was also interested in going. According to fellow war photographer Greg Marinovich, Carter saw the trip as an opportunity to fix some problems \"he felt trapped in\". To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\". To pay for the travel  Carter secured some money from the Associated Press and others, but needed to borrow money from Marinovich, for commitments back at home too. Not known to Carter and Silva was all the time that the UN Operation Lifeline Sudan did have \"great difficulties in securing funding for Sudan pancake\", explains Marinovich. Marinovich wrote further: \"The UN hoped to publish the famine Without publicity to show the need, it was difficult for URLanisations to sustain funding\". About the political differences and fighting \"Joo and Kevin knew none of this they just wanted to get in and shoot pictures\". Waiting in Nairobi Silva and Carter had prepared carefully for the trip. They stopped in Nairobi on their way to Sudan. The new fighting in Sudan forced them to wait in Nairobi for an unspecified period of time. In between Carter was flying with the UN for one day to Juba in south Sudan to take photos of a barge, with food aid for the region . But soon the situation changed again. The UN received permission from a rebel group to fly food aid to Ayod. Also Rob Hadley was flying on a UN light plane in and invited Silva and Carter to fly with him to Ayod. In Ayod The next day  their light aircraft touched down in the tiny hamlet of Ayod with the cargo aircraft landing shortly afterwards. The residents of the hamlet have been looked after by the UN aid station for some time. Greg Marinovich and Joo Silva described that in the book The Bang Bang Club, Chapter 10 \"Flies and Hungry People\". The child was already cared for before Kevin Carter and Joo Silva landed there and Carter took his famous picture. Marinovich wrote that the villagers were already waiting next to the runway to get the food as quickly as possible: \"Mothers who had joined the throng waiting for food left their children on the sandy ground nearby.\" Silva and Carter separated to take pictures of both children and adults, both the living and dead, all victims of the catastrophic famine that had arisen through the war. Carter went several times to Silva to tell him about the shocking situation he had just photographed. Witnessing the famine affected him emotionally. Silva was searching for rebel soldiers who could take him to someone in authority and when he found some soldiers Carter joined him. The soldiers did not speak English, but one was interested in Carter's watch. Carter gave him his cheap wristwatch as a gift. The soldiers became their bodyguards and followed them for their protection. To stay a week with the rebels they needed the permission of a rebel commander. Their plane was due to depart in an hour and without the permission to stay they would be forced to fly out. Again they separated and Silva went to the clinic complex to ask for the rebel commander and he was told the commander was in Kongor, South Sudan. This was good news for Silva, as \"their little UN plane was heading there next\". He left the clinic and went back to the runway, taking pictures of children and adults on his way. He came across a child lying on his face in the hot sun he took a picture. In 2011, the child's father revealed the child was actually a boy, Kong Nyong, and had been taken care of by the UN food aid station. Nyong had died four years prior, c. 2007, of \"fevers\", according to his family.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Kevin was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\".","after_edit":" To take photos in Sudan was an opportunity for a better career as freelancer, and Carter was apparently \"on a high, motivated and enthusiastic about the trip\".","label":"meaning-changed","raw_intents":["clarity","meaning-changed","meaning-changed"]}

Today Maliseet people have also migrated to other parts of the world. Maliseets are forest, river and coastal people within their 20,000, 000 acre, 200 mile wide, and 600 mile long Saint John river watershed homeland . Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine. Wlastkw means \"Beautiful River.\" English colonists later named it the Saint John River. Wlastkwewiyik means \"People of the Beautiful River,\" in Maliseet.LeSourd, Philip, ed. 2007. Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people.

Also starting from the 18th century  the ethnonym digor is widely used by travelers and in Russian official documents. Based on these facts, Ossetian Soviet linguist-Iranist Vasily Abaev suppose that the Digors could be an iranized Circassian tribe and the first part of the name - dig- can have the same roots with the Circassian endonym Adyge and -or can be just a prefix for plurality as in many contemporary Caucasian languages.

{"doc_id":172474.0,"context":"Exercise and lactate During power exercises such as sprinting, when the rate of demand for energy is high, glucose is broken down and oxidized to pyruvate . Lactate is then produced from the pyruvate faster than the body can process it, causing lactate concentrations to rise. Lactate is the end product of glycolysis and increased circulating levels of lactate are associated with increased muscle glycogen breakdown with exercise. Circulating lactate levels have been found higher in heat-sensitive patients with variants in genes encoding the skeletal muscle calcium release channel, as compared to asymptomatic carriers of the same variants. The production of lactate is beneficial for NAD+ regeneration (pyruvate is reduced to lactate while NADH is oxidized to NAD+), which is used up in oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate during production of pyruvate from glucose, and this ensures that energy production is maintained and exercise can continue. During intense exercise, the respiratory chain cannot keep up with the amount of hydrogen ions that join to form NADH, and cannot regenerate NAD+ quickly enough. Lactate served as a metabolic fuel being produced and oxidatively disposed in resting and exercising muscle.  In 2004, Robergs et al. maintained that lactic acidosis during exercise is a \"construct\" or myth, pointing out that part of the H+ comes from ATP hydrolysis (ATP4 + H2O ADP3 + + H+), and that reducing pyruvate to lactate (pyruvate + NADH + H+ lactate + NAD+) actually consumes H+. Lindinger et al. countered that they had ignored the causative factors of the increase in [H+]. After all, the production of lactate from a neutral molecule must increase [H+] to maintain electroneutrality. The point of Robergs's paper, however, was that lactate is produced from pyruvate, which has the same charge. It is pyruvate production from neutral glucose that generates H+: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Subsequent lactate production absorbs these protons: 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH 2 + 2NAD+ Overall: C6H12O6 + 2NAD+ + 2ADP3 + 2 2 + 2H+ + 2NADH + 2ATP4 + 2H2O 2 + 2NAD+ + 2ATP4 + 2H2O Although the reaction glucose 2lactate + 2H+ releases two H+ when viewed on its own, the H+ are absorbed in the production of ATP.

Traditional epistemology focuses on topics such as the analysis of the nature of knowledge, usually in terms of justified true beliefs , the sources of knowledge , like perception or testimony, the structure of a body of knowledge, for example in the form of foundationalismor coherentism, and the problem of philosophical skepticism or the question of whether knowledge is possible at all . These inquiries are usually based on epistemic intuitions and regard beliefs as either present or absent . Bayesian epistemology, on the other hand, works by formalizing concepts and problems, which are often vague in the traditional approach. It thereby focuses more on mathematical intuitions and promises a higher degree of precision. It sees belief as a continuous phenomenon that comes in various degrees, so-called credences. Some Bayesians have even suggested that the regular notion of belief should be abandoned. But there are also proposals to connect the two, for example, the Lockean thesis, which defines belief as credence above a certain threshold. Justification plays a central role in traditional epistemology while Bayesians have focused on the related notions of confirmation and disconfirmation through evidence. The notion of evidence is important for both approaches but only the traditional approach has been interested in studying the sources of evidence, like perception and memory. Bayesianism, on the other hand, has focused on the role of evidence for rationality: how someone's credence should be adjusted upon receiving new evidence. There is an analogy between the Bayesian norms of rationality in terms of probabilistic laws and the traditional norms of rationality in terms of deductive consistency.

They are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within their seeds , and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, \"angiosperm\" literally means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure; in other words, a fruiting plant. The term comes from the Greek words ('case') and ('seed') . The ancestors of flowering plants diverged from the common ancestor of all living gymnosperms during the Carboniferous, over 300 million years ago, with the earliest record of angiosperm pollen appearing around 134 million years ago. The first remains of flowering plants are known from 125 million years ago.

{"doc_id":483672.0,"context":"Most land trusts are URLanizations which owns and manages land, and sometimes waters. There are three main types of land trust, distinguished from one another by the ways in which they are legally structured and by the purposes for which they URLanized and operated . A real estate investment trust is a fiduciary arrangement whereby one party (the trustee) agrees to own and to manage real property for the benefit of a limited number of beneficiaries. Aldrich, R. Wyerman, J. 2005 National Land Trust Census Report (2006), Land Trust Alliance A community land trust (CLT) is a private, nonprofit corporation that acquires, manages, and develops land for a variety of purposes, primarily for the production and stewardship of affordable housing, although many CLTs are also engaged in non-residential buildings and uses. A conservation land trust is a private, non-profit corporation in the US that acquires land or conservation easements for the purpose of limiting commercial development and preserving open space, natural areas, waterways, and\/or productive farms and forests. Another of landholding is sometimes referred to as a \"trust\" in the United States ; approximately of land are owned by the United States government and held in trust for Native American tribes and individuals .U.S. Department of the Interior. Office of the Special Trustee. History. In Australia, Aboriginal land trusts are a type of URLanisation that holds the freehold title to an area of land on behalf of a community of Aboriginal and\/or Torres Strait Islander people. History Ancient example Possible earliest concept of equity in land held in trust is the depiction of this ancient king (trustor) which grants property back to its previous owner (beneficiary) during his absence, supported by witness testimony (trustee). In essence and in this case, the king, in place of the later state (trustor and holder of assets at highest position) issues ownership along with past proceeds (equity) back to the beneficiary:  Land trusts have been actively used in Illinois for over a hundred years and in recent decades have begun to be used in other states. The declaration of a trust is through a \"deed to trustee\". If the trust is filed as a public document, it removes all of the asset protection provided by the formation of the land trust. Robert Pless pioneered the use of the land trust that has been used by many firms throughout the United States since the early 1990s.   Conservation land trusts The Land Trust Alliance, formed in 1981, provides technical support to land trusts in the United States. The Alliance performs a National Land Trust Census that keeps track of the land protected by local and regional land trusts. The last Census, conducted in 2003, reported that these trusts have protected almost 9.4million acres (38,000km2) of land in the United States, double the 4.7million acres (19,000km2) recorded in the 1998 survey. Over 5million acres (20,000km2) of that was protected by conservation easement in 2003. Although it does not include national or international land trusts in its Census, the LTA estimates another 25million acres (100,000km2) in the U.S. have been protected by URLanizations. The largest amount of land protected by local and regional trusts is in the Northeast with 2.9million acres (12,000km2), while the fastest growing region between 1998 and 2003 was the Pacific (consisting of California, Nevada, and Hawaii), with protected land increasing 147\\% to 1.5million acres (6,100km2) in 2003.

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again.

On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing.

During that drought extending for twelve years, the great sages (who practiced Vedic traditions and who were settled on the banks of Saraswati River) for the sake of sustenance, migrated from the river valley (9:51). However, Sage Saraswata continued to live on the banks of the Saraswati. After the drought of 12 years had died, the great sages solicited one another for lectures on the Vedas.

Then all the great Rishis came to that spot, and jointly asked him to teach them the Vedas.

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered. On June 15th, the body of 45-year-old Joanne O'Rourke was found. Arrest Atkins was arrested on rape charges on August 21, 1992, after he was identified on a Detroit street by 34-year-old Darlene Saunders, who had been sodomized and raped by him in October 1991. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% He was questioned again, but categorically denied any involvement, claiming that he had no interest in women and was a homosexual. After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her. In several cases, he was unable to explain why he committed the murders: this was the case with Hardy, with whom Benjamin had an intimate relationship, but after doing drugs together, he said he strangled her for no apparent reason.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction.","after_edit":" Disgusted with his mother's actions, he left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction.","label":"meaning-changed","raw_intents":["meaning-changed","coherence","meaning-changed"]}

{"doc_id":17250911.0,"context":"Early life Benjamin Thomas Atkins was born on August 26, 1968 in Detroit, the younger of two sons. His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered.

After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women. He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her. In several cases, he was unable to explain why he committed the murders: this was the case with Hardy, with whom Benjamin had an intimate relationship, but after doing drugs together, he said he strangled her for no apparent reason.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier .

In modern-day Taiwanese politics, the KMT primarily competes with rival Democratic Progressive Party, opposing de jure Taiwan independence and Chinese unification under \"One Country, Two Systems,\" instead favoring cordial cross-strait relations with China by endorsing the 1992 Consensus and maintaining Taiwan's status quo under the Constitution of the Republic of China. The current chairman is Johnny Chiang. The Kuomintang is one of two major political parties in contemporary in China, the other being the Chinese Communist Party  . The Kuomintang traces its origins to the Revive China Society, which was founded by Sun Yat-sen in 1894 to promote the republican revolution in China and overthrow the crumbling Qing dynasty. The party was formally established in 1919 during the Beiyang regime. From 1926 to 1928, the KMT under Chiang Kai-shek successfully led the Northern Expedition against regional warlords and unified the fragmented nation. From 1937 to 1945, the Nationalists led China through the Second Sino-Japanese War against the Empire of Japan. By 1949, the KMT was decisively defeated by the Chinese Communist Party in the Chinese Civil War and withdrew the Nationalist government to Taiwan, which was restored to the ROC at the end of World War II. From 1949 to 1987, the Kuomintang ruled Taiwan under martial law hostile to the Communist mainland  , before Chiang Ching-kuo  lifted authoritarian restrictions and initiated democratic reforms in the late 1980s. During this period, the KMT also oversaw Taiwan's economic development but experienced diplomatic setbacks, including the Republic of China losing its United Nations seat and the United States switching diplomatic recognition to the People's Republic of China in the 1970s.

The KMT reclaimed power with the landslide victory of Ma Ying-jeou in the 2008 presidential election, whose presidency from 2008 to 2016 substantially improved cross-strait relations.

Pakistani security forces reported Jadhav as a serving officer in the Indian Navy and stated that he was commissioned to the Research and Analysis Wing  , India's external intelligence agency. They believed him to be involved in subversive activities in Balochistan and Karachi. Jadhav was soon shifted to Islamabad for interrogation. While according to Indian sources, Jadhav was kidnapped by Mullah Shahozi of Jaish ul-Adl from Chabahar and was transported via Sarbaz to IranPakistan border and where he handed Jadhav over to the Pakistani Army. In a statement issued in the Parliament of India on 11 April 2017, Rajnath Singh, India's Minister of Home Affairs, reiterated that Jadhav was kidnapped by Pakistani agencies from Iran and put through trial as a R AW agent. Sushma Swaraj, India's Minister of External Affairs said there was no evidence of any wrongdoing by Jadhav and termed his sentencing an act of \"premeditated murder\". Swaraj said that if Pakistan implemented the death sentence, the bilateral relations between both countries would face dire consequences.

India and Pakistan both sent their legal teams to put forward their arguments, led by Harish Salve and Khawar Qureshi QC respectively.

In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I.

They are the indigenous people of the Wlastk River (Saint John River) valley and its tributaries , and their territory extends across the current borders of New Brunswick and Quebec in Canada, and parts of Maine in the United States. The Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, based on the Meduxnekeag River in the Maine portion of their traditional homeland, are since 19 July 1776, the first foreign Treaty allies with the United States of America and a federally recognized tribe of Maliseet people by the United States .

Name The people call themselves Wlastkwewiyik after the Wlastkw River at the heart of their expansive territory in what is now New Brunswick and Maine.

Tales from Maliseet Country: The Maliseet Texts of Karl V. Teeter, Lincoln, Nebraska: University of Nebraska Press, p. 17, fnote 4 The Maliseet (Malecite) have long been associated with the Saint John  . Their territory still extends as far as the Saint Lawrence River. Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages. Malesse'jik was a Mikmaq word believed to mean \"He speaks slowly,\" or differently  by which the Mikmaq people contrasted the other tribe's language to their own. The meaning of the word today is unknown but  is commonly mistranslated to \"he speaks badly, lazy, or broken\"  Erickson 1978, pg. 135 This term is the exonym by which the Mikmaq people referred to this group when speaking to early Europeans. The Europeans met the Mikmaq people before the Wlastkwewiyik, and adopted Malesse'jik as Malcite in French for the people, not understanding that it was not their true name. The later English colonists anglicized this term as Maliseet, in another transliteration of sound  . 17th century At the time of European encounter, the Wlastkwewiyik were living in walled villages and practicing horticulture (corn, beans, squash and tobacco). In addition to  growing crops, the women gathered and processed fruits, berries, nuts and natural produce. The men contributed by fishing and hunting  . Written accounts in the early 17th century, such as those of Samuel de Champlain and Marc LesCarbot, refer to a large Malecite village at the mouth of the Saint John River. Later in the century, sources indicate their headquarters had shifted upriver to Meductic, on the middle reaches of the Saint John River. The French explorers were the first to establish a fur trade with the Wlastkwewiyik, which became important in their territory. Some European goods were desired because they were useful to Wlastkwewiyik subsistence and culture. The French Jesuits also established missions  where some Wlastkwewiyik converted to Catholicism. With years of colonialism, many learned the French language. The French called them Malcite, a transliteration of the Mi'kmaq name for the people. Local histories depict many encounters with the Iroquois, five powerful nations based south and east of the Great Lakes, and the Innu  . Contact with European fisher-traders in the early 17th century and with specialized fur traders developed into a stable relationship which lasted for nearly 100 years. Despite devastating population losses to European infectious diseases, to which they had no immunity, these Atlantic First Nations held on to their traditional coastal or river locations for hunting, fishing and gathering , and were concentrated along river valleys for trapping.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy people , who also still speak related Algonquian languages.","after_edit":" Their lands and resources are bounded on the east by the Mikmaq people, on the west by the Penobscot people , and on the south by the Passamaquoddy  , who also still speak related Algonquian languages.","label":"others","raw_intents":["others","style","clarity"]}

The innovator's dilemma: When new technologies cause great firms to fail. Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I. C. 1985. Milestones for successful venture planning. Harvard Business Review, 63(5): 8490 Conventional project management tools, such as stage-gate models or the use of financial tools to assess innovation  have been found to be flawed in that they are not well suited for the uncertainty of innovation-oriented projects Rajesh, S. & Zafar, I. 2008.

Blank as a foundational idea in the lean startup methodology Blank, S. (2013). \"Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything. \" Harvard Business Review  91(5): 63-72. A discovery driven plan incorporates five disciplines or plan elements: Definition of success for the plan or initiative, including a 'reverse' income statement Benchmarking against market and competitive parameters Specification of operational requirements Documentation of assumptions Specification of key checkpoints Using discovery-driven planning, it is often possible to iterate the ideas in a plan, encouraging experimentation at lowest possible cost. The methodology is consistent with the application of real options reasoning to business planning, in which ventures are considered 'real' options.

{"doc_id":250641.0,"context":"The role of the librarian has changed much over time, with the past century in particular bringing many new media and technologies into play. From the earliest libraries in the ancient world to the modern information hub, there have been keepers and disseminators of the information held in data stores. Roles and responsibilities vary widely depending on the type of library and specialist librarian, from academic libraries to public libraries, as well as the functions needed behind the scenes to maintain the collection and make it available to its users. The Great Library of Alexandria, created by Ptolemy I after the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, was created to house the entirety of Greek literature. It was notable for its famous librarians: Demetrius, Zenodotus, Eratosthenes, Apollonius, Aristophanes, Aristarchus, and Callimachus. These scholars contributed significantly to the collection and cataloging of the wide variety of scrolls in the library's collection. Most notably, Callimachus created what is considered to be the first subject catalogue of the library holdings, called the pinakes. The pinakes contained 120 scrolls arranged into ten subject classes; each class was then subdivided, listing authors alphabetically by titles. The librarians at Alexandria were considered the \"custodians of learning\". As the crisis escalated,  was a high demand for contact tracers, and the CDC had earlier named librarians as key public health staff to support COVID-19 case investigation and contact tracing, so many librarians and library staff volunteered to help with contact tracing. Librarians also supported their community in other ways  such as staffing non-emergency hotlines and manning shelters for the homeless, for which they were able to retain their income, while others were furloughed for a time. Additional responsibilities Experienced librarians may take administrative positions such as library or information center director or learning resource officer. Similar to the management of any URLanization, they are concerned with the long-term planning of the library, and its relationship with its URLanization (the city or county for a public library, the college\/university for an academic library, or URLanization served by a special library). In smaller or specialized libraries, librarians typically perform a wide range of the different duties. upJustin Winsor, Librarian of Congress, c. 1885 Representative examples of librarian responsibilities: Researching topics of interest for their constituencies. Referring patrons to other URLanizations and government offices. Suggesting appropriate books (\"readers' advisory\") for children of different reading levels, and recommending novels for recreational reading. Reviewing books and journal databases Working with other URLanisations to establish continual, lifelong learning and further education initiatives Facilitating and promoting reading clubs. Developing programs for library users of all ages and backgrounds. Managing access to electronic information resources. Assessing library services and collections in order to best meet library users' needs. Building and maintaining collections to respond to changing community needs or demands Creating pathfinders Writing grants to gain funding for expanded program or collections Digitizing collections for online access Publishing articles in library science journals Answering incoming reference questions via telephone, postal mail, email, fax, and chat delivering arts and cultural activities to local communities Initiating and establishing creative digital activities to introduce children to coding, engineering and website building Marking promotion and advocacy of library services Assisting job seekers and local businesses Making and enforcing computer appointments on the public access Internet computers.\"The librarian's Internet survival guide: strategies for the high-tech reference desk\", Irene E.

They can be highly specialized, serving a discrete user group with a restricted collection area. In an increasingly global and virtual workplace, many special librarians may not even work in a library at all but instead manage and facilitate the use of electronic collections. Funding for special libraries varies widely. Librarians in some types of special libraries may be required to have additional training, such as a law degree for a librarian in an academic law library or appropriate subject degrees for subject specialties such as chemistry, engineering, etc. Many belong to the Special Libraries Association. There are also more specific associations such as the American Association of Law Libraries, Art Libraries Society of North America, the American Theological Library Association, the Medical Library Association, or the Visual Resources Association.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" postal mail, email, fax, and chat delivering arts and cultural activities to local communities Initiating and establishing creative digital activities to introduce children to coding, engineering and website building Marking promotion and advocacy of library services Assisting job seekers and local businesses Making and enforcing computer appointments on the public access Internet computers.","after_edit":" postal mail, email, fax, and chat Delivering arts and cultural activities to local communities Initiating and establishing creative digital activities to introduce children to coding, engineering and website building Marking promotion and advocacy of library services Assisting job seekers and local businesses Making and enforcing computer appointments on the public access Internet computers.","label":"others","raw_intents":["fluency","others","others"]}

Drug addiction recovery groups are voluntary associations of people who share a common desire to overcome their drug addiction. Different groups use different methods, ranging from completely secular to explicitly spiritual. Some programs may advocate a reduction in the use of illegal drugs rather than outright abstention, although this is  typically not a sustainable treatment plan in the long term. One survey of members  found active involvement in any addiction recovery group correlates with higher chances of maintaining sobriety. The survey found group participation increased when the individual members' beliefs matched those of their primary support group (often people will be members of multiple addiction recovery groups). Analysis of the survey results found a significant positive correlation between the religiosity of members and their participation in twelve-step addiction recovery groups and SMART Recovery, although the correlation factor was three times smaller for SMART Recovery than for the twelve-step addiction recovery groups. Religiosity was inversely related to participation in Secular Organizations for Sobriety. A survey of a cross-sectional sample of clinicians working in outpatient facilities (selected from the SAMHSA On-line Treatment Facility Locator) found that clinicians only referring clients to twelve-step groups for treatment were more likely than those referring their clients to twelve-step groups and \"twelve-step alternatives\" to believe less strongly in the effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral and psychodynamic-oriented therapy, and were likely to be unfamiliar with twelve-step alternatives. A logistic regression of clinician's knowledge and awareness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy effectiveness and preference for the twelve-step model was correlated with referring exclusively to twelve-step groups.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" One survey of members  found active involvement in any addiction recovery group correlates with higher chances of maintaining sobriety.","after_edit":" One survey of members who found active involvement in any addiction recovery group correlates with higher chances of maintaining sobriety.","label":"others","raw_intents":["others","others","coherence"]}

History 200px|Llama effigy (earthenware, slip paint) Not much is known about the Chancay civilization, which developed in the later part of the Inca Empire. This culture emerged after the fall of the Wari civilization. Parts of the southern Chancay area were conquered by the Chim in the early fifteenth century and in about 1450 A.D. the Incas were occupying both areas. It is believed that the Chancay had a centralized political structure , forming a small regional state. Thus the Chancay culture declined in the fifteenth centuryto make way for the territorial expansion of the Inca Empire . The settlements in Lauri, Lumbra, Tambo Blanco, Handrail, Pisquillo Chico and Tronconal focused mainly on artisans producing large-scale ceramics and textiles. The Chancay culture is the first of the Peruvian cultures that had mass production of ceramics, textiles and metals such as gold and silver which were ritualistic and domestic goods. They were also noted for their wood carved items. In type of fabric used include llama wool, cotton, chiffon  and feathers. Their technique involved were decorated open weave, brocade, embroidery, and painting. Brushes were used to paint anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, geometric and other creative designs directly on the canvases. The Chancay are known for the quality of their painted tapestries. The typically geometric designs also included drawings of plants, animals such as fish, cats, birds, monkeys and dogs (most notably the hairless Peruvian dog) as well as human figures. Some of the human fiber sculptures are elaborate and include such scenes as a mother teaching her daughter to weave on a backstrap loom.

His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor. On January 25th, the body of 39-year-old Vickie Truelove was located: like the other victims, she had been sodomized, raped and strangled. At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier . Despite the fact Mitchell was found almost completely naked with a scarf wrapped around her neck , her death was originally classified as an overdose. %DIFDELCMD < %DIFDELCMD < %%% A few days later, on the 15th, the partially decomposed corpse of 27-year-old Vicki Beasley-Brown, who was last seen alive on March 25th, was discovered.

He described in detail the appearance and clothing of the victims, and even indicated the whereabouts of the bodies of the 10th and 11th victims, 21-year-old Ocinena Waymer and 29-year-old LaTanya Showanda Smith. Their disappearances were not connected to the murders until Atkins' confession, and the bodies were found on the indicated place that same day. During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her.

{"doc_id":18309949.0,"context":"A discordant system or pattern does not correlate to the topography and geology of the area. Discordant drainage patterns are classified into two main types: antecedent and superimposed, while anteposition drainage patterns combine the two. In antecedent drainage, a river's vertical incision ability matches that of land uplift due to tectonic forces. Superimposed drainage develops differently: initially, a drainage system develops on a surface composed of 'younger' rocks, but due to denudative activities this surface of younger rocks is removed and the river continues to flow over a seemingly new surface, but one in fact made up of rocks of old geological formation. Dendritic drainage patterns Dendritic drainage pattern Dendritic drainage systems (from Greek , dendrites, \"of or like a tree\") are not straight and are the most common form of  drainage system. In this, there are many sub-tributaries (analogous to the twigs of a tree), which merge into tributaries of the main river (the branches and the trunk of the tree, respectively). They are seen to feed a river channel that matches and is strongly accordant to the overriding gradient of the land. Truly dendritic systems form in V-shaped valleys; as a result, the rock types must be quite  impervious and non-porous. Trellis drainage pattern The geometry of a trellis drainage system is similar to that of a common garden trellis. Along a strike valley, smaller tributaries feed into from the steep slopes of mountain sides . These tributaries enter the main river about perpendicular, causing a trellis-like appearance of the system. They form where hard and soft formations exist on both banks of the main river, and are reflective of height, accentuated by erosion. Trellis drainage is characteristic of folded mountains, such as the Appalachian Mountains in North America and in the north part of Trinidad.Ritter, Michael E., The Physical Environment: an Introduction to Physical Geography. 2006 Rectangular drainage pattern Rectangular drainage develops on rocks that are of approximately uniform resistance to erosion, but which have two directions of jointing at approximately right angles or 90 degrees. The joints are usually less resistant to erosion than the bulk rock so erosion tends to preferentially open the joints and streams eventually develop along the joints. The result is a stream system in which streams consist mainly of straight line segments with right angle bends and tributaries join larger streams at right angles. This pattern can be found with the Arun River in Nepal.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" as a result, the rock types must be quite  impervious and non-porous.","after_edit":" as a result, the rock types must be quite obviously impervious and non-porous.","label":"style","raw_intents":["style","meaning-changed","style"]}

Boston , Mass. : Harvard Business School Press  Its main thesis is that when one is operating in arenas with significant amounts of uncertainty, that a different approach  than is normally used in conventional planning applies . In conventional planning, the correctness of a plan is generally judged by how close outcomes come to projections. In discovery-driven planning, it is assumed that plan parameters may change as new information is revealed. With conventional planning, it is considered appropriate to fund the entire project  as the expectation is that one can predict a positive outcome. In discovery driven planning, funds are released based on the accomplishment of key milestones or checkpoints, at which point additional funding can be made available predicated on reasonable expectations for future success.Block, Z. & MacMillan, I.

{"doc_id":1602860.0,"context":"In the news In 2005, internet hunting became a major news story when a man in Texas set up a webcam and remotely controlled gun to allow hunters to shoot from their computers. According to the Humane Society, most internet hunts involve game ranches where animals are kept penned, making them essentially canned hunts.Humane Society Wildlife Abuse Campaign, Another less well-known incident occurred  two years prior to the Dick Cheney hunting incident when the vice president participated in a canned hunt at the Rolling Rock Club in Ligonier Township, Pennsylvania. Cheney and nine companions killed 417 out of 500 ringneck pheasants, of which the Vice President killed 70, and an unknown number of mallard ducks. In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country. South Africa environment minister announced long-awaited restrictions on lion hunting, declaring he was sickened by wealthy tourists shooting tame lions from the back of a truck and felling rhinos with a bow and arrow. This comes in response to the imbroglio created over the potential canned hunt of the African rhinoceros 'Baixinha.' Dismissing threats of legal action by the hunting industry, Marthinus Van Schalkwyk said the new law would ban \"canned\" hunting of big predators and rhinos in small enclosures that offer them no means of escape. In addition, lions bred in captivity would have to be released into the open for at least two years before they could be hunted. Van Schalkwyk said a previously proposed six-month delay would not give lions enough time to develop self-defence instincts. \"Hunting should be about fair chase ... testing the wits of a hunter against that of the animal,\" he told a press conference. \"Over the years that got eroded and now we are trying to re-establish that principle.\" This measure was later overturned. In May 2007 a much-reported hunting trip involved the killing of 1,051pound pet pig in an alleged canned hunt. The pig was named \"Monster Pig\" by the media and it was believed that the pig was a feral hog . It was soon discovered that the pig, previously named \"Fred , \"  had been someone's pet and was then sold to a hunting facility only a brief time before he was killed. On May 3, paying customers Mike Stone and his 11-year-old son , Jamison , hunted him in a fenced enclosure. Jamison shot Fred a total of eight times over a period of three hours. A June 2007 story on CNN detailed canned hunting in South Africa and includes a video of a canned lion hunt where the animal is shot against a fence. On November 30, 2014, CBS  60 Minutes broadcast a story (\"The Lion Whisperer\") about one man's sanctuary in South Africa for 26 lions, raised in captivity, who he rescued from the fate of canned lion hunting. In November 2015, the Professional Hunters' Association of South Africa (PHASA) voted to disassociate itself from the practice of canned lion hunting in South Africa. Unless the conservation value of canned lion hunting is demonstrated to PHASA, URLanization will remain against the practice and, under penalty of expulsion, no PHASA members will be permitted to participate canned lion hunts. In November 2017  PHASA came under fire over the body's reversal of its 2015 policy against the hunting of captive-bred lions.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs, Mr. Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country.","after_edit":" In South Africa, the Minister of Environmental Affairs,  Marthinus van Schalkwyk, in 2006, announced new laws to stop the practise of \"canned hunting\" in his country.","label":"style","raw_intents":["style","clarity","others"]}
{"doc_id":50178403.0,"context":"Green hunting (  eco-hunting, green bullet concept, green darting , darting safari) is the practice of hunting game animals with tranquilizer dart guns or bows and the subsequent release of the live animals . Green hunting would typically be performed when tranquilization of the animal is necessary for veterinary, monitoring , or translocation purposes. Green hunting has been advocated as a conservation-minded alternative to destructive sport hunting, because it allows the hunter to experience the thrill of a traditional hunt without killing the animal, leaving the wildlife abundance undiminished and  contributing directly to conservation initiatives. The measurements and details of a tranquilized animal are accepted in URLanization's record books and fiberglass replicas can be made for the hunter. There are some  advantages of eco-hunting . The hunter may have the additional option to be kept regularly updated on the animal's future movements if the darting was part of a GPS collaring project. Though still costly (sometimes upwards of $25,000 USD), green hunting is more economical as fees are lower than trophy hunting (up to $ 60,000 USD). The fees finance the conservation project that necessitates an immobilized animal for micro-chipping , ear-notching, tissue collection or GPS tracking and any additional funds can be used to support the management of the protected area involved. The hunter must get within 30 meters from the animal to successfully dart it, often much closer than required for traditional hunting.

Martlet 3E The Martlet 3E was a suborbital solid rocket designed to be fired from a smaller, 7-inch (180mm) cannon used in the HARP project. Its basic concept revolved around packaging the rocket grain in a case with elastic properties to transmit the lateral strain to the gun tube. The 3E model utilized a new technique of rocket grain construction  that consisted of laminating sheet double-base propellant grain under hydraulic pressure. Martlet 4 By July 1964, the Marlet 4 program pursued the development of an orbit capable multi-stage rocket system to be launched from the 16\" Barbados gun. Two versions of full-scale orbital launch vehicle projectiles were proposed in the Martlet 4 series. The first was to have used three solid rocket motor stages and was planned to orbit approximately 50 pounds of payload. The second used liquid rocket motors and was planned to have orbited 200 pounds of payload. Both were about long and in diameter, weighing about at launch. However, no Martlet 4 vehicles were built; the project was halted before the design was completed.

{"doc_id":5467330.0,"context":"Herbert Richard Baumeister (April 7, 1947 July 3, 1996) was an American  suspected serial killer. A resident of the Indianapolis suburb of Westfield, Indiana, he was under investigation for murdering over a dozen men in the early 1990s, most of whom were last seen at gay bars. Police found the remains of eleven persons, eight identified, on Baumeister's property. After an arrest warrant was issued, Baumeister fled to Canada and killed himself before he could be brought to trial. He never confessed to the crimes and his suicide note made no mention of the murder allegations. He was later linked to a series of murders of at least nine men along Interstate 70, which occurred in the early to mid-1980s. Early life  Baumeister was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, the oldest of four children born to Herbert and Elizabeth Baumeister. His childhood was reportedly normal . By the onset of adolescence, he began exhibiting anti-social behavior . Acquaintances later recalled the young Baumeister playing with dead animals and urinating on a teacher's desk , which are textbook signs of a burgeoning serial killer . In his teens, he was diagnosed with schizophrenia , but did not receive further psychiatric treatment. In 1965, Baumeister attended Indiana University for a semester before dropping out, but returned in 1967. In 1972, he attended a semester at Butler University. As an adult, he drifted through a series of jobs, marked by a strong work ethic , but also by increasingly bizarre behavior. Baumeister married Juliana \"Julie\" Saiter in November 1971, a union that produced three children. Julie later said they had been sexually intimate only six times in over 25 years of marriage. In the 1970s, Baumeister was committed to a psychiatric hospital by his father . His wife said he was \"hurting and needed help.\" Baumeister founded the successful Sav-A-Lot thrift store chain (two stores total) in Indianapolis in 1988. Investigation By the early 1990s, investigators with the Marion County Sheriff's Department and the Indianapolis Police Department began investigating the disappearances of gay men of similar age, height, and weight in the Indianapolis area. In 1992, they were contacted by a man named Tony Harris claiming that a gay bar patron calling himself \"Brian Smart\" had killed a friend of his, and had attempted to kill him with a pool hose during an erotic asphyxiation session. Harris eventually saw this man again in August 1995, following him and noting a license plate number. From this data, police identified \"Brian Smart\" as Herb Baumeister. Investigators approached Baumeister, told him he was a suspect in the disappearances, and asked to search his house. Both Baumeister and his wife, Julie, refused to allow a search of their house . By June 1996, however, Julie had become sufficiently frightened by her husband's mood swings and erratic behavior that, after filing for divorce, she consented to a search. The search of the estate, Fox Hollow Farm, was conducted while Baumeister was on vacation. It turned up the remains of eleven men, eight of whom were identified. Baumeister would posthumously be suspected of killing nine other men, the bodies of whom were found in rural areas along the corridor of Interstate 70 between Indianapolis and Columbus, Ohio  during the early to mid 1980s. One eyewitness identified Baumeister as the man seen leaving a bar in 1983 with Michael Riley, who was later found dead. Like the other victims, Riley was strangled to death and deposited nude or semi-nude in a river.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" By the onset of adolescence, he began exhibiting anti-social behavior .

His family lived in a poor neighborhood, and both of his parents were drug and alcohol abusers. Shortly after his birth, Tony's father left the family. In 1970, Benjamin ran away from home, and without parental supervision, wound up in an orphanage, where he spent his childhood and youth. While living there, he was physically assaulted by other children, and at the age of 10, was raped by one of the employees. Over the next five years, he was continuously subjected to sexual harassment by other boys, until he eventually escaped and reunited with his mother. For sometime, he lived together with her and his older brother, but  realised that his mother worked as a prostitute. Both Atkins and his brother saw her have sex with clients at the house on several occasions. Atkins left the house again in the late 1980s, living on the streets and doing drugs, and eventually developed a drug addiction. Because he lacked formal education, Atkins was forced to work in low-skilled labor jobs for low wages, and spent the nights at homeless shelters. Acquaintances claimed to be very fond of him, but at the same time noted that when drunk or on drugs, he showed signs of an antisocial personality and displayed misogynistic behavior. Murders As victims, Atkins chose vulnerable women, often prostitutes or drug addicts. He would lure them to abandoned buildings and houses, where he sexually assaulted  them. After strangling his victims, he would leave the bodies at the crime scenes, with some of them discovered months after their deaths. The first victim to be discovered was 30-year-old Debbie Ann Friday, found on December 14, 1991, after she had gone missing on December 8th. A few days later, on December 30th, the body of 26-year-old Bertha Jean Mason was found. She had gone missing on December 11th, and was last seen leaving her home and entering a store, after which she was never seen alive again. On January 3, 1992, while demolishing an abandoned house, workmen discovered the body of 36-year-old prostitute and drug addict Patricia Cannon URLe, who had been put on a wanted list in early December 1991 following a drug den bust within Woodward Corridor.

At the end of January, Atkins was arrested at an abandoned building and taken to the police station for interrogation. Due to lack of evidence to prove his guilt in the murders, he was released. On February 17th, the corpses of three women were found in three separate rooms in the former Monterey Hotel in Highland Park: they were 34-year-old Valerie Chalk, 23-year-old Juanita Hardy and a Jane Doe whose identity remains unknown. All of them had been raped and strangled . Relatives of Chalk told the police that after she was put on a wanted list in early November 1991, Valerie went missing. On April 9th, the body of 28-year-old Brenda Mitchell was found in an abandoned house, after she had gone missing four days earlier .

During the interrogation, Atkins said that the motive for the murders was his misogynistic views against girls and women engaged in prostitution.  Contrary to the official version of the investigation, Atkins revealed that the first victim had actually been Patricia URLe, whom he killed in the fall of 1991. According to his testimony, he didn't plan on killing the woman, but simply planned to smoke crack cocaine with her. When she decided to leave him, he flew into a rage and killed her. In several cases, he was unable to explain why he committed the murders: this was the case with Hardy, with whom Benjamin had an intimate relationship, but after doing drugs together, he said he strangled her for no apparent reason.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Atkins to admit to the murders of 11 women.","after_edit":" After further interrogations, the police officers familiarized him with the psychological portrait they had compiled of the killer, which, after 12 hours, caused Tony admit to the murders of 11 women.","label":"style","raw_intents":["style","others","style"]}

{"doc_id":29305513.0,"context":"Legacy of nationalization of history Nation mythologies, histories and states An ancient Finnish Hero Illustration from Kalevala One of the most important consequences of printed texts of nationalized history was that it provided a basis for national revivals in the process of creating modern nations. Projects of national awakenings captured nationalized history and turned it into a weapon of popularization of national myths in the period of establishing history as a social scientific discipline. A shortcut to production of national mythologies that proves ancient origins of modern nations, providing them with a respectable past, was URLery of historical documents, literature and historical works that were lost for some time, and then suddenly rediscovered to the approval of an astonished grateful public. Authors of such rediscovered treasures that were in a quest for success and glory did not suspect that they were in fact builders of as yet nonexistent modern nations. Even when it was obvious that certain texts were basically invented national myths, many social groups, and even intellectuals, wanted to believe that they were authentic national epics, like the Kalevala in Finland. The nationalization of history, which had its origins more in the epics and tendentious oratory than in philosophy, sometimes grew the idea of an esprit des peuples or national spirit , and , later still , the idea that each nation had a 'mission'. Such ideas did not evolve into groups of associated individuals, but into universal spirits that is said to be able to destroy individuals and nations. Nationalization of history was an important element of national revival and creating new nation states in the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. New nation states and their institutions had the most important role in social process of the professionalization and institutionalization of history that was additionally supporting the process of nationalization of history. The final consequence was that national history regarded the nation-state as the primary unit of historical analysis. Society and nature 250px|State entities on the former territory of Yugoslavia, 2008. Nationalization of history affects all aspects of life, from relationships with other nationalities to architecture. This is a result of the fact that nationalization of history corresponds with nationalization of nature , and the fact that reservations and hostilities toward other nations accompanied nationalism from the beginning. At the end of the 20th century there were extreme nationalistic interpretations of Balkan and Caucasus history, which became powerful weapons in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union.Pakier, Strth; p. 39, \"In the Balkan and Caucasian parts of Europe, history in extreme nationalistic interpretations developed into powerful weapon in ethno-territorial conflicts and accelerated disintegration of multi-national states like Soviet Union and Yugoslavia.\" After disintegration of multinational states like Yugoslavia and Soviet Union, besides the process of renationalization of history, there is sometimes also retroactive nationalization of victims or tragedies of the people that in past lived in those states. According to new national historical narratives, the reason for some people were the victims of certain tragedies was because they were of a certain nationality, for example the Ukrainians of the Soviet Union.Zhurzhenko, The geopolitics of memory, \" An important consequence of the delegitimization of the Soviet historical narrative and the (re-)construction of national histories after 1991 is the retroactive nationalization of victims.... According to the new national historical narrative, they were killed by the Soviet regime because they were Ukrainians  \" Nationalist discourse in Croatia presents the aftermath of Bleiburg repatriations as an event where only Croatians suffered and died just because they were Croatians , eluding the fact that many of the victims were Serbs, Montenegrins or Slovenians while many Croatians had died while fighting as collaborators against Yugoslav partisans. Denationalization of history Nationalization of history has been increasingly called into question, and one of its consequences is the emerging of processes of denationalization of history, which is the result of an intention to change the perspective of creating works about history by promoting pluralism and international standards in social sciences. In Central and Eastern Europe there are tensions between nationalization of history and the process of European integrations. That is one of reasons URLanized activities aimed toward denationalization of history. In cases when history was reinterpreted and filtered by the media and official orthodoxy  there is a situation in which  nationalization of history leads to its denial.","domain":"wiki","before_edit":" Such ideas did not evolve into groups of associated individuals, but into universal spirits that is said to be able to destroy individuals and nations.","after_edit":" Such ideas evolved not into groups of associated individuals, but into universal spirits that is said to be able to destroy individuals and nations.","label":"style","raw_intents":["clarity","style","style"]}

Thus the Chancay culture declined in the fifteenth centuryto make way for the territorial expansion of the Inca Empire . The settlements in Lauri, Lumbra, Tambo Blanco, Handrail, Pisquillo Chico and Tronconal focused mainly on artisans producing large-scale ceramics and textiles. The Chancay culture is the first of the Peruvian cultures that had mass production of ceramics, textiles and metals such as gold and silver which were ritualistic and domestic goods.

The typically geometric designs also included drawings of plants, animals such as fish, cats, birds, monkeys and dogs (most notably the hairless Peruvian dog) as well as human figures. Some of the human fiber sculptures are elaborate and include such scenes as a mother teaching her daughter to weave on a backstrap loom.

In the libertarian movement The primary concern of most Civil Libertarians is the government's reach over the individual. In theory, the civil libertarian seeks to reduce the role of government to a minimum - preferring private businesses to fill the many social needs for most Americans.

The Civil Libertarian sees the government's role as critical - supporting free enterprise and the privatization of government programs wherever improvements are possible. One of the central pillars of Civil Libertarianism is free speech. In many cases Civil Libertarians oppose bans on hate speech and obscenity.
