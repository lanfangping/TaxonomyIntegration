{"before":"Jack Petersen is the coolest dude ever. Mateship''' is an [[Australia]]n [[Culture|cultural]] [[idiom]] that embodies [[social equality|equality]], [[loyalty]] and [[friendship]]. There are two types of mateship, the inclusive and the exclusive; the inclusive is in relation to a shared situation (e.g., employment, sports, or hardship), whereas the exclusive type is toward a third party (e.g., a person that you have just met). [[Russel Ward]], in ''The Australian Legend'' (1958), saw the concept as a central one to the Australian people. ''Mateship'' derives from ''[[Mate (colloquialism)|mate]]'', meaning ''friend'', commonly used in Australia as an amicable [[form of address]].

{"before":"*'''Barry Dylan''' ([[Dave Willis]]) is Archer's arch-enemy. He began the series as Len Trexler's number two at ODIN, in which capacity he had a contentious working relationship with the ISIS staff and a casual flirtation with Lana. He has a major grudge against Archer, who was responsible for shattering Barry's femur during a botched operation in Berlin.  Barry also holds Archer responsible for the termination of Barry's engagement after having anal sex with his fianc\u00e9e, Framboise. However, Barry himself admits to Trexler that they were \"engaged to be engaged.\" Showing a petty side, Barry frequently mocks ISIS's incompetence, going so far as to offer Lana her dream job contingent on her sleeping with him. In the finale of Season 2, Barry is contracted by ISIS to retrieve Archer after he is arrested in Moscow. He agrees (contingent, again, upon Lana sleeping with him when he returns) but in the process, Barry is dropped off a fire escape by Archer in a moment of self-preservation. This results in the amputation of his right leg and several other injuries. The KGB rebuilds Barry as a cyborg under the name \"Comrade Bionic Barry\" to seek vengeance on Archer, but he goes rogue, murdering Katya Kasanova to ruin Archer's wedding. Having become mentally unhinged to the point of referring to his bloodlust as \"Other Barry\", Barry takes over the KGB, kills Nikolai Jakov and steals away the now-cyborg Katya before being stranded on the space station ''Horizon'' after Cyril destroys his ship. Taking control of Horizon, using its advanced telescopic abilities to keep tabs on Archer to launch attacks on him while ordering the crew to make him a new spacecraft to return to Earth. His return is made possible when Katya manipulates Archer into having Kreiger help finish fixing Barry's escape craft. He returns to earth, though with notable tension in his relationship with Katya, who has taken over as the leader of the KGB. Barry later returns in the Season 6 episode \"Edie's Wedding\", again intent on killing Archer, whom he reveals to Pam that Katya dumped him for Boris, Nikolai's old ally.

{"before":"Marciano is commonly remembered as a swarmer due to his use of constant pressure in the ring, but he has also been called a slugger and a brawler; he was essentially all three. A late starter in the sport with little training and a short amateur career, he lacked the skills and finesse of most heavyweight champions, but he made up for it in brute force and raw power. He was notorious early in his career for his punching power, holding eleven first-round knockouts to his name. As the opposition got better, Marciano relied on his incredible stamina, relentlessness, and ability to fight rough and swarm on the inside to get him through fights just as much as the power. He would sometimes go entire fights being pummeled by opponents such as [[Jersey Joe Walcott]], [[Ezzard Charles]], and [[Archie Moore]] but would come on strong as his opponent faded. He was also noted for hitting his opposition on their arms while they were blocking. Although this didn't score points, over the rounds it made their arms numb and essentially useless. Rocky faced criticism over his career for poor foot movement and for taking too many shots: he utilized weaving but would often be caught coming in. This, however, did not matter because he was able to take the shots. He is now known for having one of the best chins in boxing history, being knocked down just twice in his entire career, both times more to do with poor balancing rather than being dazed.","after":"Marciano is commonly remembered as a swarmer due to his use of constant pressure in the ring, but he has also been called a slugger and a brawler; he was essentially all three.

[] This solemn concert of Sacred Catholic music was presented by 140 dedicated artists (88 singers and 51 musicians), mostly youngsters. The evening began with the rendition of the [[Pontifical Anthem]] (by ''[[Gounod]]''), in honour of the See of Peter. After introductory words by the Parish Priest of the Cathedral, Fr. Leonardo Correia, the Choir sang some simple Catholic prayer-formulas, viz. \"Santa Khursachi Kuru\" (the [[Sign of the Cross]], in Konkani), \"Abun d'bashmayo\" (the [[Lord's Prayer|Our Father]] as believed by the Catholic Church to have been actually prayed by Jesus in the original Aramaic-Syrian chant), \"Namaste Mary'yame\" (the [[Hail Mary]], in Sanskrit Vedic chant), all composed and arranged by ''Rev. Romeo Monteiro''. \"Mhoima Bapak\", a Konkani doxology to the Holy Trinity, composed by ''Rev. Bernardo Cota'', ended the first part of the Concert. The second part of the performance consisted of a rendition of different versions of the Creed that encapsulates the faith of the Catholic Church. Three models of creeds were chosen for the evening: the traditional Latin [[Credo]] (in ''[[Gregorian chant]]''), [[Credo]] from the famous [[Coronation Mass]] (by ''[[W. A. Mozart]]''), and finally \"Sot'mantam\" in Konkani (by ''Fr. Monteiro''). The third part of the Musical Concert contained the Easter proclamation through the work of the reputed German composer ''[[L. van Beethoven]]'' - [[Hallelujah Chorus]] from [[Christus am \u00d6lberge]] - [[Christ on the Mount of Olives]]. This was followed by a Goan version of the Easter invocation to Mary, [[Regina caeli]] (arranged by ''Maestro Rev. [[Lourdino Barreto]]'' and orchestrated by ''Fr. Monteiro'').

{"before":"''Appearance and Reality'' comprises two volumes: \"Appearance\" and \"Reality\". Bradley argues in the first volume that most things, including objects and their qualities, time and space, causation, the self, and things-in-themselves, are appearances, while in the second volume he attempts to describe the reality these appearances misrepresent to us: the Absolute, a single cosmic experience of which people are components. Ordinary concepts provide a pragmatically useful way of thinking about the world, but being incoherent they cannot provide a satisfactory grasp of reality. Reality, as predicate, is a matter of degree: concepts are true or false of reality in different degrees. The concept of the Absolute is only a way of attempting to understand something that cannot be fully comprehended. Bradley tries to establish these conclusions by arguing that reality must have a unitary togetherness that cannot be captured by the ordinary conception of many distinct things in relation, and that all concrete reality must somehow be psychical in nature. Reality is one vast eternal self-experiencing many-in-one.<ref name=\"Sprigge\" \/>","after":"''Appearance and Reality'' comprises two volumes: \"Appearance\" and \"Reality\".
