{"before_content":"Charlie Christian (July 29, 1916 - March 2, 1942) was a famous jazz guitarist. He played with the Benny Goodman sextet starting in 1939 and is often considered the first electric guitar innovator. Goodman was initially reluctant to hire Christian, due in part to the novelty of the electric guitar, but was so impressed by Christian's playing he changed his mind.\nChristian was influenced by early acoustic guitarists like jazzman Eddie Lang and bluesman Lonnie Johnson, who had introduced the guitar solo from what had been a rhythm instrument. Christian introduced the electric guitar solo, using an amplified guitar, which with its superior sustain and volume was almost like a different instrument. Christian paved the way for the modern dominant guitar sound that was followed by other pioneers, including T-Bone Walker, B.B. King, all the way to Jimi Hendrix, all electric guitar players really. For this reason Christian was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an \"Early Contributor\". The other dominant guitar player in the 1940s was Django Reinhardt, who played acoustic guitar before the war and only took up the electric guitar long after Christiab's death. Though known mainly for his influence on electric guitar, Christian was also an important player in the development of bebop, or \"modern jazz\", and his jam sessions at Minton's Playhouse in New York City were landmarks in the evolution of bop from the then-popular, radio-friendly, accessible swing music to the more intimate and experimental bebop. This transition is readily apparent to even a casual observer in two sets of Christian recording with the sextet made on the same day. Christian and tbe rest of the sextet recorded \"Blues in B\" and \"Waiting for Benny\", which were basically bop jam sessions. The free flow of these sessions contrasts with the more formal swing music recorded after Goodman arrived. Christian contracted tuberculosis and pneumonia and died at just 25 years old. He remains a highly respected early guitar player and modern jazz innovator.","after_content":"Charlie Christian (1916-1942) was a Jazz guitarist.

Hanna-Barbera was formed in 1944 by MGM animation directors William Hanna and Joseph Barbera and live-action director George Sidney as H-B Enterprises, in order to produce sponsored films and later television commercials.\nAfter MGM shut down its animation studio in 1957, H-B Enterprises became Hanna and Barbera's full-time job, and the company was re-named Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1960. Over the years, Hanna-Barbera produced many successful cartoon shows, including The Huckleberry Hound Show, The Flintstones, Top Cat, The Yogi Bear Show, The Jetsons, Jonny Quest, Space Ghost and Dino Boy, Scooby-Doo, and The Smurfs, many of which would go on to become icons of Western pop culture. In the mid-1980s, the company's fortunes declined somewhat after the profitability of Saturday morning cartoons were eclipsed by weekday afternoon syndication. In 1991, the company was purchased by Turner Broadcasting, primarily so that Ted Turner could use its library of ca 3300 cartoon half-hours as the basis of the programming for its new Cartoon Network cable television channel. But it does not hold rights to the animated series done by Hanna-Barbera. These series were done as spin-offs from live action TV series and the ownership rights of these series remained with owners of the live action series. Re-christened H-B Production Company in 1992, and Hanna-Barbera Cartoons in 1993, the studio continued without active regular input from William Hanna or Joseph Barbera, who both went into semi-retirement yet continued to serve as ceremonial figureheads for the studio.\nDuring the late 1990s, Turner turned Hanna-Barbera towards primarily producing new material for the Cartoon Network. In 1996, Turner was bought out by Time Warner. With Bill Hanna's death in 2001, Hanna-Barbera was absorbed into Warner Bros. Animation, and Cartoon Network Studios assumed production of Cartoon Network output. Joe Barbera remained with Warner Bros. Animation as a ceremonial figurehead until his death in 2006. The Hanna-Barbera name is today only used to market properties and productions associated with Hanna-Barbera's \"classic\" works such as The Flintstones and Scooby-Doo.","after_content":"Hanna-Barbera was a company that made cartoons.

{"before_content":"Osmosis is the movement of water molecules across a semi-permeable membrane from a region of low concentration to a region of high concentration until a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached. This movement of water has the effect of equalising the concentration on both sides of the membrane.\nOsmosis is the movement of water molecules across a partially-permeable membrane down a water potential gradient. More specifically, it is the movement of water across a partially permeable membrane from an area of high water potential (low solute concentration) to an area of low water potential (high solute concentration). It is a physical process in which a solvent moves, without input of energy, across a semipermeable membrane (permeable to the solvent, but not the solute) separating two solutions of different concentrations. Osmosis releases energy, and can be made to do work. Osmosis is a passive process, like diffusion.\nNet movement of solvent is from the less-concentrated (hypotonic) to the more-concentrated (hypertonic) solution, which tends to reduce the difference in concentrations. This effect can be countered by increasing the pressure of the hypertonic solution, with respect to the hypotonic. The osmotic pressure is defined to be the pressure required to maintain an equilibrium, with no net movement of solvent. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property, meaning that the osmotic pressure depends on the molar concentration of the solute but not on its identity.\nOsmosis is important in biological systems, as many biological membranes are semipermeable. In general, these membranes are impermeable to organic solutes with large molecules, such as polysaccharides, while permeable to water and small, uncharged solutes. Permeability may depend on solubility properties, charge, or chemistry, as well as solute size. Water molecules travel through the plasma cell wall, tonoplast (vacuole) or protoplast in two ways, either by diffusing across the phospholipid bilayer directly, or via aquaporins (small transmembrane proteins similar to those in facilitated diffusion and in creating ion channels). Osmosis provides the primary means by which water is transported into and out of cells. The turgor pressure of a cell is largely maintained by osmosis, across the cell membrane, between the cell interior and its relatively hypotonic environment.","after_content":"Osmosis is the movement of water through a plasma membrane from a region of low salt concentration to a region of high concentration. Osmosis is passive transport, meaning it does not require energy to be applied. What causes osmotic pressure is different concentrations of salt ions on the two sides of the membrane. When osmosis happens, water moves from the side of the membrane with a lower amount of osmotic pressure to the side of the membrane with the higher amount. An important example of osmosis is the movement of liquid (solvent) molecules across a cell membrane into a cell with a higher solute concentration.

{"before_content":"Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a disease linked to the X chromosome. It is a result of fatty acid buildup caused by a defect in the very long chain of fatty acids transporter in peroxisomes, which then causes damage to the myelin sheath of the nerves, resulting in seizures and hyperactivity. Other symptoms include problems with speaking, listening, and understanding verbal instructions.\nIn more detail, it is a disorder of peroxisomal fatty acid beta oxidation which results in the accumulation of very long chain fatty acids in tissues throughout the body. The most severely affected tissues are the myelin in the central nervous system, the adrenal cortex, and the Leydig cells in the testes. Clinically, ALD is a heterogeneous disorder, presenting with several distinct phenotypes, and no clear pattern of genotype-phenotype correlation. As an X-linked disorder, ALD presents most commonly in males, however approximately 50% of heterozygote females show some symptoms later in life. Approximately two-thirds of ALD patients will present with the childhood cerebral form of the disease, which is the most severe form. It is characterized by normal development in early childhood, followed by rapid degeneration to a vegetative state. The other forms of ALD vary in terms of onset and clinical severity, ranging from adrenal insufficiency to progressive paraparesis in early adulthood (this form of the disease is typically known as adrenomyeloneuropathy).\nALD is caused by mutations in ABCD1, a gene located on the X chromosome that codes for ALD, a peroxisomal membrane transporter protein. The exact mechanism of the pathogenesis of the various forms of ALD is not known. Biochemically, individuals with ALD show very high levels of unbranched, saturated, very long chain fatty acids, particularly cerotic acid (26:0).
