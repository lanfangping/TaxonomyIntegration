{"before_content":"Rheology \/ri\u02d0\u02c8\u0252l\u0259d\u0292i\/ is the study of the flow of matter, primarily in the liquid state, but also as'soft solids' or solids under conditions in which they respond with plastic flow rather than deforming elastically in response to an applied force. It applies to substances which have a complex microstructure, such as muds, sludges, suspensions, polymers and other glass formers(e.g., silicates), as well as many foods and additives, bodily fluids(e.g., blood) and other biological materials or other materials which belong to the class of soft matter. Newtonian fluids can be characterized by a single coefficient of viscosity for a specific temperature. Although this viscosity will change with temperature, it does not change with the strain rate. Only a small group of fluids exhibit such constant viscosity, and they are known as Newtonian fluids. But for a large class of fluids, the viscosity changes with the strain rate(or relative velocity of flow) are called non-Newtonian fluids. Rheology generally accounts for the behaviour of non-Newtonian fluids, by characterizing the minimum number of functions that are needed to relate stresses with rate of change of strains or strain rates. For example, ketchup can have its viscosity reduced by shaking(or other forms of mechanical agitation, where the relative movement of different layers in the material actually causes the reduction in viscosity) but water cannot. Ketchup is a shear thinning material, as an increase in relative velocity caused a reduction in viscosity, while some other non-Newtonian materials show the opposite behaviour: viscosity going up with relative deformation, which are called shear thickening or dilatant materials. Since Sir Isaac Newton originated the concept of viscosity, the study of liquids with strain rate dependent viscosity is also often called Non-Newtonian fluid mechanics. The term rheology was coined by Eugene C. Bingham, a professor at Lafayette College, in 1920, from a suggestion by a colleague, Markus Reiner. The term was inspired by the aphorism of Simplicius(often misattributed to Heraclitus), panta rhei,\" everything flows\" The experimental characterization of a material's rheological behaviour is known as rheometry, although the term rheology is frequently used synonymously with rheometry, particularly by experimentalists. Theoretical aspects of rheology are the relation of the flow\/deformation behaviour of material and its internal structure(e.g., the orientation and elongation of polymer molecules), and the flow\/deformation behaviour of materials that cannot be described by classical fluid mechanics or elasticity.","after_content":"Rheology is the study of the flow of liquids and soft solids like mud or blood.","before":"'or","after":"like mudorblood","before_token_range":[19,21],"after_token_range":[12,16],"label":"semantic_elaboration_example"}

The harbor's mouth is located behind Gasparilla Island, one of the many coastal barrier islands on the southwest coast of Florida, with access from the Gulf of Mexico through the Boca Grande Pass between Gasparilla Island on the north and Lacosta Island on the south. Charlotte Harbor covers about 270\u00a0sq mi(700\u00a0km2) Charlotte Harbor Estuary is a natural estuary spanning the west coast of Florida from Venice to Bonita Springs on the Gulf of Mexico and is one of the most productive wetlands in Florida. The estuary has a large watershed, and includes Charlotte Harbor itself as well as the Peace River, Caloosahatchee River(via Pine Island Sound) and Myakka River basins. It covers 12,653 square kilometers(4,885\u00a0sq\u00a0mi), the second largest open water estuary in the state. It is classified as a bar-built estuary, formed when sandbars build up along the coastline. The sand bars block the waters behind them from the sea. Such estuaries tend to be shallow with minimal tidal action. This is a threatened ecosystem because of the rapid increase of growth and development, poor land-use policies, and the overuse of natural resources. The Charlotte Harbor Aquatic Preserves, established by the state of Florida in 1975, are five contiguous aquatic preserves within the greater Charlotte Harbor estuary. It includes salt marshes, mangroves, seagrass, oyster and tidal flats. It is the preserve of many species, including the American alligator, West Indian manatee, bald eagle, wood stork, piping plover, green and loggerhead sea turtles, royal false pawpaw(Deeringothamnus pulchellus), Florida perforate cladonia(Cladonia perforata) and many more. The harbor is fed with fresh water from the Myakka River on its northwest corner and the Peace River on its northeastern corner.

{"before_content":"Freedom of the press is the guarantee by a government of free public press for its citizens and their associations, extended to members of news-gathering organizations(journalists), and their published reporting. In many countries there are constitutional or statutory protections pertaining to freedom of the press. With respect to governmental information, any government distinguishes which materials are public or protected from disclosure to the public based on classification of information as sensitive, classified or secret and being otherwise protected from disclosure due to relevance of the information to protecting the national interest. Many governments are also subject to sunshine laws or freedom of information legislation that are used to define the ambit of national interest. In developed countries, freedom of the press implies that all people should have the right to express themselves in writing or in any other way of expression of personal opinion or creativity. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights states:\" Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference, and impart information and ideas through any media regardless of frontiers\" This philosophy is usually accompanied by legislation ensuring various degrees of freedom of scientific research(known as scientific freedom), publishing, press and printing the depth to which these laws are entrenched in a country's legal system can go as far down as its constitution. The concept of freedom of speech is often covered by the same laws as freedom of the press, thereby giving equal treatment to media and individuals. Besides legal definitions, some non-governmental organizations use other criteria to judge the level of press freedom around the world: Every year, Reporters Without Borders establishes a ranking of countries in terms of their freedom of the press. The Worldwide press freedom index list is based on responses to surveys sent to journalists that are members of partner organisations of the RWB, as well as related specialists such as researchers, jurists and human rights activists. The survey asks questions about direct attacks on journalists and the media as well as other indirect sources of pressure against the free press, such as pressure on journalists by non-governmental groups. RWB is careful to note that the index only deals with press freedom, and does not measure the quality of journalism. In 2003, the countries where press was the most free were Finland, Iceland, the Netherlands and Norway. In 2004, apart from the above countries, Denmark, Ireland, Slovakia, and Switzerland were tied at the top of the list, followed by New Zealand and Latvia. The country with the least degree of press freedom was North Korea, followed by Burma, Turkmenistan, People's Republic of China(mainland only), Vietnam, Nepal,and Iran. According to Reporters Without Borders, more than a third of the world's people live in countries where there is no press freedom. Overwhelmingly, these people live in countries where there is no system of democracy or where there are serious deficiencies in the democratic process. Freedom of the press is an extremely problematic concept for most non-democratic systems of government since, in the modern age, strict control of access to information is critical to the existence of most non-democratic governments and their associated control systems and security apparatus. To this end, most non-democratic societies employ state-run news organizations to promote the propaganda critical to maintaining an existing political power base and suppress(often very brutally, through the use of police, military, or intelligence agencies) any significant attempts by the media or individual journalists to challenge the approved\" government line\" on contentious issues. In such countries, journalists operating on the fringes of what is deemed to be acceptable will very often find themselves the subject of considerable intimidation by agents of the state. This can range from simple threats to their professional careers(firing, professional blacklisting) to death threats, kidnapping, torture, and assassination. Reporters Without Borders reports that, in 2003, 42 journalists lost their lives pursuing their profession and that, in the same year, at least 130 journalists were in prison as a result of their occupational activities. In 2005, 63 journalists and 5 media assistants were killed worldwide.","after_content":"Freedom of the press is a promise by a government not to punish journalists and other people who report the news for doing their job.

Chinese scientists subsequently isolated a new strain of coronavirus - given the initial designation of 2019-nCoV - which has been found to be at least 70 percent similar in genome sequence to SARS-CoV. With the development of a specific diagnostic PCR test for detecting the infection, a number of cases were confirmed in people directly linked to the market and in those who were not directly associated with it. Whether this virus is of the same severity or lethality as SARS is unclear. On 20 January 2020, Chinese premier Li Keqiang urged decisive and effective efforts to prevent and control the pneumonia epidemic caused by a novel coronavirus. As of 24 January 2020, 26 deaths have occurred, all in China, and there is evidence of human-to-human transmission. Extensive testing has revealed over 800 confirmed cases in China, some of whom are healthcare workers. Confirmed cases have also been reported in Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Macau, Hong Kong, the United States, Singapore, Vietnam, France and Nepal. On 23 January 2020, the WHO decided against declaring the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. The WHO had previously warned that a wider outbreak was possible, and there were concerns of further transmission during China's peak travel season around the Chinese New Year. Many New Year events have been closed over fear of transmission, including the Forbidden City in Beijing, traditional temple fairs, and other celebratory gatherings. The sudden increase in occurrences of the disease has raised questions relating to its origin, wildlife trade, uncertainties surrounding the virus's ability to spread and cause harm, whether the virus has been circulating for longer than previously thought, and the possibility of the outbreak being a super-spreader event. The first suspected cases were notified to WHO on 31 December 2019, with the first instances of symptomatic illness appearing just over three weeks earlier on 8 December 2019. The market was closed off on 1 January 2020, and people who showed signs and symptoms of the coronavirus infection were isolated. Over 700 people, including more than 400 healthcare workers who came into close contact with possibly infected individuals, were initially monitored. After the development of a specific diagnostic PCR test for detecting the infection, the presence of 2019-nCoV was subsequently confirmed in 41 people in the original Wuhan cluster, of which two were later reported to be a married couple, one of whom had not been present in the marketplace, and another three who were members of the same family that worked at the marketplace's seafood stalls. The first confirmed death from the coronavirus infection occurred on 9 January 2020. On 23 January 2020, Wuhan was placed under quarantine, in which all public transport in and out of Wuhan has been suspended.

Calcite is an ionic salt called calcium carbonate or CaCO3. It forms under reasonably deep marine conditions from the gradual accumulation of minute calcite shells(coccoliths) shed from micro-organisms called coccolithophores. Flint(a type of chert) is very common as bands parallel to the bedding or as nodules embedded in chalk. It is probably derived from sponge spicules or other siliceous organisms as water is expelled upwards during compaction. Flint is often deposited around larger fossils such as Echinoidea which may be silicified(i.e. replaced molecule by molecule by flint). Chalk as seen in Cretaceous deposits of Western Europe is unusual among sedimentary limestones in the thickness of the beds. Most cliffs of chalk have very few obvious bedding planes unlike most thick sequences of limestone such as the Carboniferous Limestone or the Jurassic oolitic limestones. This presumably indicates very stable conditions over tens of millions of years. Chalk has greater resistance to weathering and slumping than the clays with which it is usually associated, thus forming tall steep cliffs where chalk ridges meet the sea. Chalk hills, known as chalk downland, usually form where bands of chalk reach the surface at an angle, so forming a scarp slope. Because chalk is well jointed it can hold a large volume of ground water, providing a natural reservoir that releases water slowly through dry seasons.","after_content":"Chalk is a soft, white, sedimentary rock that is porous.

Biological development(that is, puberty) and psychosocial development, however clearer boundaries relate to physical development.\" Adolescence\" is a cultural and social phenomenon and therefore its endpoints are not easily tied to physical milestones. The word derives from the Latin verb adoare meaning\" to grow up.\" The time is identified with dramatic changes in the body, along with developments in a person's psychology and academic career. In the onset of adolescence, children usually complete elementary school and enter secondary education, such as middle school or high school. A person between early childhood and the teenage years is sometimes referred to as a pre-teen or tween. The ages of adolescence vary by culture and penis size.

In contrast, in the United States, adolescence is generally considered to begin around age 12 or 13, and end at 19 or 20. During this period of life, most children go through the physical stages of puberty which often begins between the ages of nine and thirteen. Most cultures regard people as becoming adults at various ages of the teenage years. For example, Jewish tradition considers males to be adult members of the community at age 13 and females at age 12, and this transition is celebrated in the Bat Mitzvah for girls and the Bar Mitzvah for boys.

During the Soviet era there were major manufacturing industries in Isfana, but the difficult economic situation since independence has resulted in widespread factory closures.

{"before_content":"Robert Anthony Eden, 1st Earl of Avon, KG, MC, PC(12 June 1897 - 14 January 1977) was a British Conservative politician, who was Prime Minister from 1955 to 1957. He was also Foreign Secretary for three periods between 1935 and 1955, including during the Second World War. In the post-war years, Eden was a protagonist of the change in British policy on war criminal trials, which was perhaps best symbolised by his signature under the pardon conceded to the German Field Marshal Albert Kesselring on 24 October 1952. Eden's worldwide reputation as an opponent of appeasement, a'Man of Peace', and a skilled diplomat was overshadowed in the second year of his premiership by his handling of the Suez Crisis of 1956, which critics across party lines regarded as an historic setback for British foreign policy, signalling the end of British predominance in the Middle East.

He was appointed Foreign Secretary in 1935 by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, and resigned in 1938 in protest at Chamberlain's appeasement of Adolf Hitler. He was Churchill's Foreign Secretary during World War II, and again in 1951-1955. He had operation to remove gallstones in 1953. The operation went wrong, and his health was ruined. He became Prime Minister in 1955 when Winston Churchill retired. He stopped being Prime Minister in 1957 when Harold Macmillan replaced him. The Suez Crisis of 1956 was a critical period. This and his health led up to his resignation as Prime Minister. Eden died of liver cancer, aged 79. His widow, Clarissa Eden, Countess of Avon, is in her early nineties. She is a niece of Winston Churchill. Eden's life can be described in two halves. The first half, in the 1930s and in wartime, was brilliant.

New Atelopus species are discovered with some regularity and many new species have been described in the last decade(see following species table).
