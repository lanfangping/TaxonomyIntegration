{"before_content":"Hanna-Barbera was an animated cartoon production company that dominated television animation during the second half of the 20th century. Hanna-Barbera was formed in 1944 by MGM animation directors William Hanna and Joseph Barbera and live-action director George Sidney as H-B Enterprises, in order to produce sponsored films and later television commercials.\nAfter MGM shut down its animation studio in 1957, H-B Enterprises became Hanna and Barbera's full-time job, and the company was re-named Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1960. Over the years, Hanna-Barbera produced many successful cartoon shows, including The Huckleberry Hound Show, The Flintstones, Top Cat, The Yogi Bear Show, The Jetsons, Jonny Quest, Space Ghost and Dino Boy, Scooby-Doo, and The Smurfs, many of which would go on to become icons of Western pop culture. In the mid-1980s, the company's fortunes declined somewhat after the profitability of Saturday morning cartoons were eclipsed by weekday afternoon syndication. In 1991, the company was purchased by Turner Broadcasting, primarily so that Ted Turner could use its library of ca 3300 cartoon half-hours as the basis of the programming for its new Cartoon Network cable television channel. But it does not hold rights to the animated series done by Hanna-Barbera. These series were done as spin-offs from live action TV series and the ownership rights of these series remained with owners of the live action series. Re-christened H-B Production Company in 1992, and Hanna-Barbera Cartoons in 1993, the studio continued without active regular input from William Hanna or Joseph Barbera, who both went into semi-retirement yet continued to serve as ceremonial figureheads for the studio.\nDuring the late 1990s, Turner turned Hanna-Barbera towards primarily producing new material for the Cartoon Network. In 1996, Turner was bought out by Time Warner. With Bill Hanna's death in 2001, Hanna-Barbera was absorbed into Warner Bros. Animation, and Cartoon Network Studios assumed production of Cartoon Network output. Joe Barbera remained with Warner Bros. Animation as a ceremonial figurehead until his death in 2006. The Hanna-Barbera name is today only used to market properties and productions associated with Hanna-Barbera's \"classic\" works such as The Flintstones and Scooby-Doo.","after_content":"Hanna-Barbera was a company that made cartoons.

{"before_content":"Lamellibrachia is a genus of tube worms related to the giant tube worm, Riftia pachyptila. It lives at deep-sea cold seeps where hydrocarbons (oil and methane) are leaking out of the seafloor. It is entirely reliant on internal, sulfide-oxidizing bacterial symbionts for its nutrition. L. luymesi provides the bacteria with hydrogen sulfide and oxygen by taking them up from the environment and binding them to a specialized hemoglobin molecule. Unlike the tube worms that live at hydrothermal vents, Lamellibrachia uses a posterior extension of its body called the root to take up hydrogen sulfide from the seep sediments. Lamellibrachia may also help fuel the generation of sulfide by excreting sulfate through their roots into the sediments below the aggregations.\nThe most well-known seeps where L. luymesi lives are in the northern Gulf of Mexico from 500 to 800 m depth. This tube worm can reach lengths of over 3 m (10 ft), grows very slowly, and may hold the longevity record for an invertebrate with individuals living to be over 250 years old.[dubious \u2013 discuss] It forms biogenic habitat by creating large aggregations of hundreds to thousands of individuals. Living in these aggregations are over a hundred different species of animals, many of which are found only at these seeps.\nWhile most species of vestimentiferan tubeworms live in deep waters below the photic zone, Lamellibrachia satsuma was discovered in Kagoshima Bay, Kagoshima at a depth of only 82 m, the shallowest depth record for a vestimentiferan.","after_content":"Seep tube worms (which are of the genus Lamellibrachia) are related to the giant tube worms.

He played with the Benny Goodman sextet starting in 1939 and is often considered the first electric guitar innovator. Goodman was initially reluctant to hire Christian, due in part to the novelty of the electric guitar, but was so impressed by Christian's playing he changed his mind.\nChristian was influenced by early acoustic guitarists like jazzman Eddie Lang and bluesman Lonnie Johnson, who had introduced the guitar solo from what had been a rhythm instrument. Christian introduced the electric guitar solo, using an amplified guitar, which with its superior sustain and volume was almost like a different instrument. Christian paved the way for the modern dominant guitar sound that was followed by other pioneers, including T-Bone Walker, B.B. King, all the way to Jimi Hendrix, all electric guitar players really. For this reason Christian was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as an \"Early Contributor\". The other dominant guitar player in the 1940s was Django Reinhardt, who played acoustic guitar before the war and only took up the electric guitar long after Christiab's death. Though known mainly for his influence on electric guitar, Christian was also an important player in the development of bebop, or \"modern jazz\", and his jam sessions at Minton's Playhouse in New York City were landmarks in the evolution of bop from the then-popular, radio-friendly, accessible swing music to the more intimate and experimental bebop. This transition is readily apparent to even a casual observer in two sets of Christian recording with the sextet made on the same day. Christian and tbe rest of the sextet recorded \"Blues in B\" and \"Waiting for Benny\", which were basically bop jam sessions. The free flow of these sessions contrasts with the more formal swing music recorded after Goodman arrived. Christian contracted tuberculosis and pneumonia and died at just 25 years old.
