{"before_content":"Osmosis is the movement of water molecules across a semi-permeable membrane from a region of low concentration to a region of high concentration until a state of dynamic equilibrium is reached. This movement of water has the effect of equalising the concentration on both sides of the membrane.\nOsmosis is the movement of water molecules across a partially-permeable membrane down a water potential gradient. More specifically, it is the movement of water across a partially permeable membrane from an area of high water potential (low solute concentration) to an area of low water potential (high solute concentration). It is a physical process in which a solvent moves, without input of energy, across a semipermeable membrane (permeable to the solvent, but not the solute) separating two solutions of different concentrations. Osmosis releases energy, and can be made to do work. Osmosis is a passive process, like diffusion.\nNet movement of solvent is from the less-concentrated (hypotonic) to the more-concentrated (hypertonic) solution, which tends to reduce the difference in concentrations. This effect can be countered by increasing the pressure of the hypertonic solution, with respect to the hypotonic. The osmotic pressure is defined to be the pressure required to maintain an equilibrium, with no net movement of solvent. Osmotic pressure is a colligative property, meaning that the osmotic pressure depends on the molar concentration of the solute but not on its identity.\nOsmosis is important in biological systems, as many biological membranes are semipermeable. In general, these membranes are impermeable to organic solutes with large molecules, such as polysaccharides, while permeable to water and small, uncharged solutes. Permeability may depend on solubility properties, charge, or chemistry, as well as solute size. Water molecules travel through the plasma cell wall, tonoplast (vacuole) or protoplast in two ways, either by diffusing across the phospholipid bilayer directly, or via aquaporins (small transmembrane proteins similar to those in facilitated diffusion and in creating ion channels). Osmosis provides the primary means by which water is transported into and out of cells. The turgor pressure of a cell is largely maintained by osmosis, across the cell membrane, between the cell interior and its relatively hypotonic environment.","after_content":"Osmosis is the movement of water through a plasma membrane from a region of low salt concentration to a region of high concentration. Osmosis is passive transport, meaning it does not require energy to be applied. What causes osmotic pressure is different concentrations of salt ions on the two sides of the membrane. When osmosis happens, water moves from the side of the membrane with a lower amount of osmotic pressure to the side of the membrane with the higher amount. An important example of osmosis is the movement of liquid (solvent) molecules across a cell membrane into a cell with a higher solute concentration.

{"before_content":"Learning music by ear is done by repeatedly listening to other musicians and then attempting to recreate what one hears. This is how people learn music in any musical tradition in which there is no complete musical notation. Many people in cultures which do have notation still learn by ear, and ear training is common practice among those who use notation extensively.\nIn the West learning by ear is associated with traditional and folk music, but many classical music forms throughout the world lack notation, and have therefore been passed from generation to generation by ear.\nThe Suzuki method of teaching music focuses on playing by ear from a very young age. In his book \"Teaching from the Balance Point,\" Edward Kreitman, a US based Suzuki Teacher, clearly distinguishes \"learning by ear\" as a separate, completely different process from \"learning by rote\". See also: Music lesson","after_content":"Learning music by ear is learning to play a piece of music by listening to other people playing it and then trying to play it oneself. In some musical traditions there is no written music and everybody plays by ear all the time. Folk music is traditionally learned by listening to other musicians and copying them. This is how music is passed from one generation to another.\nMost people in the Western musical tradition learn pieces and songs by reading music, but it is good to try to play music by ear sometimes. It can be a very useful skill.\nThe Suzuki method of learning instruments started in Japan but is now used in many countries.

Although it has only around 16,000 inhabitants, the town is home to the renowned 'University of Music Trossingen' (with its famous Early Music department), which is one of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's five state conservatories, and there are several other institutions specializing in musical education, like the 'Bundesakademie f\u00fcr musikalische Jugendbildung' and the 'Hohner Konservatorium' .\nIn 1830 Christian Messner from Trossingen, a cloth maker and weaver, copied a harmonica brought to Trossingen by his next door neighbor, a clockmaker from Vienna. This was the beginning of musical instrument production in the town. Messner was so successful at making such instruments that eventually his brother and some relatives also started making harmonicas. From 1840 on his nephew Christian Weiss started working on his own, so by 1855 there were two registered businesses - Christian Messner & Co. and W\u00fcrtt. Harmonikafabrik Ch. WEISS. Trossingen is also the home of the world's oldest extant harmonica manufacturer, C.A Seydel Sohne, founded in 1847.\nSee German Wikipedia page about de:Christian Messner.\nIn 1857 the Matthias Hohner company was founded. Today, Hohner harmonicas and accordions are well known all over the world.
