A clarity change (i.e. change of similar meaning word; from ‘sites’ to ‘plots’) has been made; which can also be seen repeated 6 times in the entire paper; once in method section; twice in data analysis section; once in results section; and twice in discussion section. The first edit in the introduction section was addition of a citation. And the second edit was a change in the claim where approaches usually used to analyse the potential benefit of disturbance has been added instead of just few studies.In the study-site section under method, three factual information was added, first and second being information about secondary forest plots and shrub swamp. The third was the limitation of the study and why the survey could not be conducted every month. Next, a sentence was updated with the number of times the audible sound was recorded. The final edit in this section was the change of work from habitat to plots.The first modification in the data analysis section was a fact/evidence where additional information about the number of recordings collected per slot was added. In the first sentence of split and modify, an assumptions made during the study was added and in the second sentence a clarity change was made i.e. the subject for the sentence was borrowed from the first sentence. Next, additional factual information about plot i.e alpha richness and habitat i.e. gamma richness levels was added. Again another fact containing the step by step process on how the study counted the bird abundance was updated. A clarity change was also made in this sub-section where a phrase was reordered to simplify the sentence.  There was an addition of a fact in this section about the models and how it was checked. At the end of this section, factual information was updated about how the data was pooled to visualise the composition of the bird community. Majority of the changes in the result section was fact/evidence; the first edit was updating the total number of birds that have been detected. The second edit was also about updating the number of individual bird that could not be identified and how that has led to the increase in the working dataset. The third edit was addition of the information about the study area i.e. primary forest and the shrub swamp where the fourth edit was updating the Marginal significance value from 0.053 to 0.068. In this sub-section, there were in total 4 new sentences added and all of them were fact/evidence changes; in the first sentence information about error bar was added whereas in the second one, mean values of the result and how they are indicated in the error bar was added. Following that, there was an evidence added from other authors about how means are significantly different when their confidence intervals do not overlap along with citation. And finally information about how abundances are treated in the result was mentioned. In the discussion section two claims were added; the first one was about how the changes in bird community could lead to a bigger and more mobile species where the second change was  about why wild bird trapping was worrisome.There were minor clarity edits in following sentences to increase the intensity of the sentence i.e. ‘these human activities’ to ‘all these human activities’; ‘National Park of Berbak provided’ to National Park of Berbak still provided’. Clarity changes were also made to simplify the sentences i.e. ‘forest sites’ to forest. Grammar changes were also made in this sub-section where verb was changed from plural to singular (were to was) and from uncountable noun to countable noun i.e ’twice as much’ to ‘twice as many’. There was only one modification in this sub-section where a claim was added about how Javan Myna might establish feral populations.
