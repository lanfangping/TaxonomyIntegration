The first change made was clarity modification in the title of the paper. In the abstract only obe fact change was made.
The first change made in the Introduction was a claim correction by deleting the word "metaplasticity". Then authors changed the statement by adding factual information from the third party and the modification of the citations. Also researchers add a factual sentence to explain why they have used ephrin-A2- and another statement explaining their aimto examine a learning mediated effect of rTMS. 
In the Methods authors added factual statement explaining why randomised littermates were not used. Then authors made a factual change by explaining mice age in equivalent with humans. In the nest sentence grammar change was made.
The factual statement describing why authors have decided to stimulate after the task was added in the "Apparatus and Procedure". 
In the "rTMS application" authors made a factual change by adding the citation. in the nest sentence also factual citation correction was made. Then authors made a factual correction that the pulse was monophasic. Also researchers split the sentence into two parts in order to better explain the coil stimulation. After that a number of the fact sentnecs was added explaining the differences of the coil usage in the cat and mice studies. 
A claim correction was made explaining the difficulty of making conclusions based on the null results in the Discussion section. In the next sentence claim change connected with the adverse effects in the study was made.
In the next Section authors made a factual change (in mice -> in different strain of mice). A clarity word smithing change was made about the lack of studies. Also authors deleted the claim statement about the need of the further research. Two claim sentence were added instead explaining in detail what can be done in the future.
Authors made two factual changes in two separate sentences by adding the citations. One of this sentence was moved to another section of the paper. Also one factual sentence was deleted. A claim change was made by the deleting the statement "is in line with our behavioural results". Next correction was small clarity change (rTMS stimulation sessions -> rTMS sessions). After that authors added 4 sentences detaily explaining the possible influence of the timing of rTMS on the outcome of the experiments. Another paragraph containing 4 sentences was added, where authors described in detail the limitations of the of their rodent scaled rTMS delivery device.
