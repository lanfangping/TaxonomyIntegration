The first change that was made is the grammar correction according to the convention. In the "Methods" section factual sentence was added about the collection of the samples of each brand. Also punctuation correction was made in this section.
In the "Results" authors added the fact&evidence sentence concerning the strains resistance to the antibiotics for different types of samples. Then researchers made several fact/evidence changes, where they updated references, and also they reformulated one sentence for the better understanding of the text without significant meaning change.
Two factual sentences with the infromation from the third parties about the usage of the antibiotics were added as well as the addition of two claim statements exaplaining potential effect of the brands onto antibiotic resistance.
