In the introduction section, the citation year from Hinton et al. was modified in a sentence. A claim about Metadistil’s ability of parameter adjusting was modified.  In the related work section, a citation from Xu et al., & Xu & McAuley was added, and the citation year of Hinton et al. was modified again.  Also, two sentences were modified to fix grammatical mistakes. In one sentence here, the conjunction was modified to improve clarity.
