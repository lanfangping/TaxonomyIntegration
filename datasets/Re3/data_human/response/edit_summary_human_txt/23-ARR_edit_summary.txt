In the abstract section, firstly a grammatical error was fixed in a sentence. Then one sentence was split into two and clarity was enhanced. Three sentences were linked into two sentences and there were grammar and clarity changes in them. Finally, a sentence with the authors claim about their goal of the work was deleted. In the introductions section, two sentences were modified to improve clarity and one was modified to change the claim of the author. Also, there was one sentence with fixed grammar and one fact concerning the schema expansion was modified in the sentence. Finally, a sentence with the link of the authors benchmarks and codes for the experiments was added. In the backgrounds section, one sentence was modified which did not seem correct and labelled as other. Then after that there were two sentences with clarity improvements and two sentences with grammatical changes. In the proposed evaluation benchmarks section, there was only one sentence change which included a grammatical error solve. In the next section, there was one sentence where punctuation was deleted to fix grammar and two sentences were modified to enhance clarity. In the squall repartitioning section one sentence was added which made the claim about the authors models and what it needed to learn to do well in the dataset. In the proposed method section, there were changes in quite a few sentences to improve clarity including one split sentence and one merged sentence. Also, there was a claim change in one sentence which was split into a new one. Two sentences were merged into one and in one sentence a claim about the different types of columns was modified. There was a sentence modification to improve clarity in the schema expansion section. In schema pruning section, one fact was modified about how some columns were left unpruned. Also, one fact was modified where the example of irrelevant column i.e., negative column sampling was removed. Finally, there was a change in clarity in a sentence. In experimental setup, one sentence was modified to fix grammatical mistakes. Then one sentence was added which explained the authors claims about the SQUALL researchers. Two sentences were added then which briefly demonstrated authors data regarding out of domain generalization and the data selected to be reported. In the results there was only one modified sentence which consisted of clarity improvement. Finally, in the conclusions section, there was one sentence with grammar fixed and one sentence was modified to improve clarity. Then two sentences were added which describe the authorâ€™s claims about the new table schema and how it worked well being limited to specified column types. Lastly there were two sentences with claim changes, which illustrated the authors view on how their work can motivate the future works related to this challenge.
