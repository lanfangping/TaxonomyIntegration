In the abstract, there is a claim change of removing the word "mishandle" and instead talking about particular challenges for the models. There is also a fact change explaining how the adversarial training is optimized, as well as two small wording clarity modifications.
At the beginning of the introduction, a few more clarity changes are found, along with a grammar change and a sentence split with a fact change about the importance of verb handling for the ED task. Later on, there are more minor clarity changes, a change of claim saying that sentences containing events should provide an ED system with relevant information and a fact change regarding the used datasets. At the end of the introduction, information about the paper structure was added.
There are a few clarity changes in the Problem Definition and Baseline Model sections (mainly wordsmithing), as well as a fact change explaining that the vectors hi are generated by the mBERT encoder.
In the Adversarial Language Adaptation section, a third-party fact was changed to add that the adapter modules from Majewska et al. (2021) are task specific.
The Optimal Transport section has a couple of wording clarity changes, and the Problem Formulation has a sentence split into a small clarity change and a fact change of removing author's information. A fact about the labels for target-language data being unavailable was also added.
There are two clarity changes in the Datasets section. After that, the whole Hyper-parameters section was added, providing author's details about the used hyperparameters.
In the Main Results, a few minor clarity changes are found. There are also some fact changes and additions regarding a new used baseline and a citation added. The Ablation Study has only one clarity modification.
The Learned Representation Distances section has one grammar change, while the Access to Labeled Target Data section has an added fact about a figure with experiment results.
In the Related Work, there are a few citation changes. The conclusion has two minor clarity modifications, as well as the fact change of removing the word "unlabeled" regarding the used data and extending information about the methods. There is also the added claim that their optimization of adversarial training is task independent and can be generalized to other related tasks.
