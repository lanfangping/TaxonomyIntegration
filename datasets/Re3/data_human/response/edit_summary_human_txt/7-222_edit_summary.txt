In the title of this paper, the singular form (grammar) of Ilanganates National Park was changed to Ilanganates National Parks. In the abstract section, claim about the tools which was used to identify the taxonomy of Fungi was deleted. A clarity change was made to the beginning of the sentence where ‘a record’ has been changed to ‘all analysed collections present here’. Following that, a fact change was undertaken from one record being able to be identified to four samples. Towards the end of abstract, a claim, about how the would contribute to design and implement measures for the conservation of fungi in Ecuador was added. At the end of this section, factual information about the building of a phylogenetic tree of Maximum Likelihood was deleted. In introduction section, in the first sentence, information about ITS being accepted as primary fungal barcode marker has been added along with a citation. Whereas, in the second sentence information about the method of the study was added. The sub-title of the methods section has been changed from obtaining the sequences to Sequencing. The name of the company which provided the primers was deleted in the first paragraph of this section. A minor clarity change has been administered to point the sequences obtained for each isolates. Following that, a factual information about consensus sequence being manually edited was deleted. A the end of this sub-section, two sentences were added about the research methodology and how the results were compared. 
Another sub-section under methods, a minor grammatical change in the first sentence and reordering of the information in the sentence next to that was conducted. In the result section, majority of the changes was related to Clarity; Sentences were edited where a word has been replaced with similar meaning another word (i.e from collected to analysed, decision making to decision or vice-versa, it could be to it is possible). Grammatical changes have been made where deletion of verb, addition of punctuation mark were done.Three claims has been added in this sub-section first being the claim about the specimen belonging to a new species. The second claim added was about the need for more detailed morphological analyses and the last claim was about the limited number of studies that have been conducted in the National Parks of Ecuador. A claim was modified about sampling effort being different in each park. A factual information about Clade B has been added. And factual information about why Xylarya and X. Telfairii species are considered different species was deleted. Information about the bootstrap in Clade C being greater than 95, in Clade E being greater than 95 and in Clade F being equal to 100 was deleted . Further, Clade D being the closest sequence to Xylaria was deleted. At the end of the result section, a minor clarity change was done to amplify the meaning of the unidentified specimens. 
In the conclusion section, few minor clarity changes was done.
