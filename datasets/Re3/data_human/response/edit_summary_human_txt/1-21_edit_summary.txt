At the end of the introduction, the claim of terminal investment not being observed in "bacteria and phage" was changed to "bacteria subject to phage infection".
In the results section, there are five small grammar changes, a small wording change for clarity, added information from the experiments regarding the unchanged distribution of forward scatter and the added claim that bacterial shape probably remained unchanged throughout the experiment.
In the discussion, the authors wrote the word "bacterial" to specify which progeny has increased survival chances and added many claims about the reasons for this response considering their experiment setup, the way bacteria function, as well as their predictions. The fact that the results are related to previous observations from third parties was added, and the authors also added a claim with some thoughts on the speed of phage killing bacterial hosts in the experiments of Gomez and Buckling. After that, a sentence was modified for clarity and another sentence was modified for grammar. There is also an added claim about the response being expected to result in smaller individual size.
At the end of the discussion, the authors modified a sentence to add the fact that there was no advantage of being exposed to inacitvated phage and extended the claimed suggestions for future studies saying that the adaptive nature of the response, as well as how it affects mechanisms of infeciton, recovery and resistance, should be investigated in greater depth.
There are a couple of grammar changes in the preliminary tests section and the added claim that the centrifugation method removed bound and unbound phage. The authors also added the fact that no bound phages were seen after centrifugation.
In the experiments using UV-inactivated phage, there is a clarity change for meaning extension and an added fact regarding how KB medium containing UV-inactivated phages was obtained in our experiments.
There is a clarity format change in the measures section, as well as added claims about measures of OD being affected by changes in particle size, the reasons for this and also that the authors are conservative about the impact of phage exposure on growth rate.
