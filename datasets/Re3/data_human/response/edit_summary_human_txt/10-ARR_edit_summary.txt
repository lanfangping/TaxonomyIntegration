They also explained the pecularities of such conversations and confirmed it with the evidence statement. In the following sentence citation was deleted as it is added before for clarification. Two next changes were connected with clarity modifications (inference-> inference based on the commonsense knowledge and quit smoking -> smoke cessation). Then authors added a claim sentence about possible challenges for language models. Next two corrections were clarity changes with a intent of word smithing.
