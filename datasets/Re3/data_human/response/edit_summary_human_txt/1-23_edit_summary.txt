In the Late complications section, a claim was modified to add a reason for excessive scarring and a sentence was changed for clarity.
The Comments have an added claim about level I evidence not being available and another one regarding the design of RCT being unethical. Three sentences were merged together, with the claim change that the studies should be taken into consideration even if they are imprecise and unreliable, as well as a few clarity changes. Third-party and author's facts about data collection were removed, and a lot of claims regarding the low reliability of data in the studied context were also removed.
In the Religious and cultural views section, claims about gender bias were excluded. Finally, the Final remarks section title was changed to Conclusions.
