The topic of the study was changed to the electric fields of non-invasive electric brain stimulation instead of the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation. Similar change i.e. from the effects to the electric fields was also made twice in the abstract. 
The first three changes in the introduction was addition of reference number for the citations. Next, electrode was added in front of rotation, and type to make it more understandable. 
The sub-title methods was changed to methods and results. 
In the section creation of head models, information about automated tissue segmentation conducted in major air cavities was added. Next, the claim about head models not being suitable for estimating stimulation-related E-fields in brainstem Nuclei was changed to cerebellum. Further claim was added about the segmentation of the brainstem. Following that, additionally was replaced with furthermore. A fact was then added about an extended head model along with the reference for the citation. A clarity change was made about the pre-release version of SimNIBS 2.1. Further, factual information about the air cavities being modeled was added. There was a minor convention change of a sign -. 
In the section dataset validation, a factual information about FreeSurfer 5.3.0 being implemented in mri2mesh  was updated. A clarity change was administered to simplify the sentence where the subject was changed from this new SimNIBS pipeline to this pipeline. Following that, a fact was added about a custom pipeline. Further, a claim about how same accuracy can be achieved using headreco was added. A factual change was made in this sentence where figure number where the head models were shown was deleted. The next edit was addition of an automated atlas-based parcellation of the frontal lobe in the sentence to amplify the meaning of the sentence. Following that, a reference number was added in the list of the result. A fact was further added about how accessing group differences between MDD and healthy subjects was not the primary aim of the current data. A clarity change was administered where the results presented in figure 4 was changed to these results and that of figure 4. 
In the section usage notes, the version of SimNIBS was updated from 2.0 to 2.1.1. Following that a claim about the older version of SimNIBS not allowing exporting the resulting E-field maps into FreeSurfer was deleted. Next, wordings of the sentences were changed about the script outputting data registered. Information about the cons of upcoming version of SimNIBS was updated to clarify the sentence as the new version was used in the study.
