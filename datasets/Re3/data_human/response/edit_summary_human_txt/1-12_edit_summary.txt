In the "The fact(or)s" section there is a clarity change for simplification and a minor grammar change. Right after that, in the hypothesis section, we have another clarity change regarding word order and simplification.
Still in this section, there are some added facts from third parties about plasmepsin V and the ER membrane, one added reference, as well as one added claim regarding the N-terminal hydrophobic domain likely being a transmembrane signal anchor and one changed claim about plasmepsin V being tethered to the ER membrane by hydrophobic regions. Another minor grammar change was also made.
Further in the document, in the "The way out" section, there are a couple of grammar changes.
The authors did not change the explanation for mDHFR fusion constructs, nor did they add a graphical explanation of the topology. No explanation for PMV possessing an N-terminal hydrophobic region was added, the PNEP export explanation was not elaborated and no alternatives to cytoplasmic actylation were discussed.
