In the introduction section, a clarity change was made where a different connecting word was used. A typo with ranker was corrected. Following that, a grammar change from initialised to initial was made. And at the end of this section, a sentence was re-written with to summarise at the beginning.
In the section related-work, claim about the Pinecone managing service 2 and a fact about the methodology of the paper was added.
Two sentences were deleted in the Dimensionality reduction section; the first one was the explanation of the input and the side information for the researchâ€™s use where the second was the evidence about the resulting dimensional encoded vector. 
Under the section quantization, the fact about the study following DRIVE approach has been changed to a similar approach called EDEN quantization. Similar changes were also made once in end to end latency evaluation section, and once in additional measurement section.
In the section tasks and dataset, the first change was a clarity change where unlike the above was replaced with unlike MSMARCO-DEV and many passages was changed to multiple passages. Following that, another sentence was merged into the same sentence where the subject of the old sentence was removed and verb was changed into a gerund. Two facts were added in this section; first being information about CAR and how it maps from articles and second was how automatic by-article annotations variant is used. The final edit in this section was a clarity change where bigger challenge was replaced with significant challenge. 
A fact change was administered in the Baseline-Bert split section where pre-trained weights 2 was changed to pre-trained weights 4. 
In the SDR configuration and training, a typo was corrected from it to in.
In the title of this section, evaluation was changed to evaluation results. In the same section a face was deleted about the checkpoints being released with the published paper.
Additional information about Distilbert model being full interaction architecture was added in the end to end latency evaluation section.
Information about measuring the error rate for different input vectors was deleted in the additional measurement section. Then information retrieval was abbreviated as IR in the following edit. In the same section, a clarity change with the choice of words from has a better focus to can better focus was made. Also, towards the end of this section, another clarity change was done where appear was changed to are provided. Along with that, there were two grammatical changes in the section; first being the change of verb from singular to plural and the second being the form of word from plural to singular.
In the conclusion section, a factual modification about the late-interaction model was made. Six times in this sub-section, DRIVE quantization was changed to EDEN quantisation where in one instance, DRIVE bias correction (DRIVE-BC) was changed to EDEN bias correction (EDEN-BC). A solid results provided by SDR was updated. Furthermore, information about TREC CAR dataset as compared to BM25 has been changed. At the end of this section, the score achieved by SDR-20 was updated from 0.315 to 0.314.
