In the abstract, the acc@10 result was changed from 28% to 24%, and there is a wording clarity change.
At the beginning of the introduction, a citation was added and the fact that the work was done at Cambridge was added. After that, there are more related citations added.
In the MedLAMA section, information was moved from the appendix to table 2. After this section, in Existing Multi-token Knowledge Probing Approaches, some facts were added: the authors use a cloze-style query, the model predicts the masked token in an autoregressive manner and an illustration is provided. More information about retrieval-based probing and specifically probing PLMs on MedLAMA was added, as well as a claim regarding previous works. At the end of this section, more author's facts about the objective function and a subsection regarding retrieval-based probing were added.
Citations and third-party methods were added in the Experiments section. Accuracy values were also modified, and details on results were moved. At the end of the section, author's facts about contrastive probing and a subsection title were removed, while new facts and a claim about the performance of PubMedBERT were added. The subsection title "In-depth Analysis of Contrastive-Probe" was also added.
The section Comparing with BioLAMA was created, and facts about this comparison were moved from the end of the document, with a change in citation and some clarity changes. With this, more claims regarding the promising performance of Contrastive-Probe were added.
Limitations of Contrastive-Probe is also a new section. Here, the authors added some information about training and results, as well as some claims regarding the challenges of using this method.
In the Related Work and Discussion, many facts about third-party methods were removed. The subsection title "Biomedical Knowledge Probing" was also removed, along with information about these methods and a short comparison with the presented method.
The conclusion has a change of accuracy from 28% to 24% again, and information about table 5 and BioLAMA was removed. At the end of this section, the authors added some facts regarding their training and hyperparameters.
