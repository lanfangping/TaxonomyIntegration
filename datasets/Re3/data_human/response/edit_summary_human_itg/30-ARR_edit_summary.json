One fact about the use of static semi-factual generation and RDL was modified. In introduction, the authors modified 4 sentences to improve clarity. Then one citation by Lu and MacNamee was added in a sentence. One more citation by Kenny and Keane was added in the next modified sentence. After that a grammatical error was fixed by the author in a sentence. Then two factual sentences explaining the authors found experimental data trained with RDL and its comparison with Kaushik et al. performances were removed. One sentence demonstrating the claim of the authors about being the first to exploit this issue was deleted. Finally, one fact was deleted which announced the availability of the resources on GitHub. A section title named Related work was deleted. One fact by Gururangan et al., Srivastava et al. and Kaushik et al. about the data augmentation was deleted. After that the citation year of Wu et al. was modified in a sentence. Then one sentence was modified to improve clarity and a citation from Li et al. and yang et al. was added in another sentence. In the method section, three facts were added which explained the authors data found from figure 2 about the all model-identified rationales. Rationale marking section changes began with the authors modifying two sentences to improve clarity. There were two sentences with grammatical changes as well. Finally in one sentence a fact was modified where the authors added the section numbers which explained their annotation procedure. In the static semi-factual generation section, there were two modified sentences to fix grammatical issues. There was only one sentence modified to enhance clarity in the dynamic human-intervened correction section. A citation by Wu et al. and Warstadt and Bowman was deleted in a sentence in the 'Why does RDL work?' section. In the evaluating static semi factual generation section two facts were added which demonstrated the authors experimental approach for the comparison of the performance of models. There were two sentence updates with grammatical changes in the experimental setup section. In the results and analysis section there were changes in four sentences for clarity improvement and in three sentences for grammatical error fix. Finally, a claim by the authors was modified from multiplication of original examples to duplication of original examples. In the next section one sentence was modified to improve clarity. In results and analysis section two sentences were modified to enhance clarity and one sentence was modified to fix grammatical error. In the conclusion section a claim about the usage of rationale-centric framework in future was added by the authors. One new section named Ethical statement was added, where there was an added sentence which claimed that the authors honored the ACL code of ethics. Finally, two facts were added which mentioned the originality of the data used in the work and the renumeration for the annotator's services.",
