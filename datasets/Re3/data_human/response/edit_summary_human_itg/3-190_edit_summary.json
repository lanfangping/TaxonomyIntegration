A fact about R.terraenovae recapture number was added in the results section. Also the time-at-liberty of R.terraenovae and number of sharks recaptured were modified in two sentences here. One figure containing the Vertebrae section was added and mentioned as fact in one sentence. A fact about the background of tagging study was added in the Carcharhinus acronotus section. Also, two sentences were merged and word smithing was done to improve clarity. Another figure with the vertebral section was added and pointed out here in a sentence. In the age estimates and comparisons section two sentences were deleted which explained some facts from the papers table 2 about the longevity of R.terraenovae and C. acronotus. In the discussions section, one sentence was modified to fix the grammar error and one was modified by simplification to improve clarity. Finally, there was fact change where the number of sharks encountered was modified.",
