In the squall repartitioning section one sentence was added which made the claim about the authors models and what it needed to learn to do well in the dataset. In the proposed method section, there were changes in quite a few sentences to improve clarity including one split sentence and one merged sentence. Also, there was a claim change in one sentence which was split into a new one. Two sentences were merged into one and in one sentence a claim about the different types of columns was modified. There was a sentence modification to improve clarity in the schema expansion section. In schema pruning section, one fact was modified about how some columns were left unpruned. Also, one fact was modified where the example of irrelevant column i.e., negative column sampling was removed. Finally, there was a change in clarity in a sentence. In experimental setup, one sentence was modified to fix grammatical mistakes. Then one sentence was added which explained the authors claims about the SQUALL researchers. Two sentences were added then which briefly demonstrated authors data regarding out of domain generalization and the data selected to be reported. In the results there was only one modified sentence which consisted of clarity improvement. Finally, in the conclusions section, there was one sentence with grammar fixed and one sentence was modified to improve clarity.
