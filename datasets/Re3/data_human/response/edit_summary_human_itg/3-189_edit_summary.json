A fact explaining the location of stations for the dogfish was deleted. The introduction section was updated by fixing grammatical error in citations in two sentences. We also modified a fact here from Ruilfson et al. and mentioned that their data was not recorded. The methods section was vastly simplified by deleting quite a few factual sentences which explained our methodical approach and executed tasks. We also modified two sentences by changing the facts about our shark capturing data. Furthermore, two sentences were merged, and clarity was enhanced. In the results section we deleted a few sentences explaining the data we found from our experiments. The recorded depth value of the station was modified in one sentence. Finally in the discussion section we corrected a few sentences where there were some minor punctuation errors in the citations. Furthermore, we deleted some sentences with our claims about the spiny dogfish.  Also, a fact about sharks by Heithaus et al. was deleted as well.",
