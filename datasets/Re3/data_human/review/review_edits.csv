Why were mice tested before the low field pulsed magnetic stimulation session and not also immediately thereafter, when the impact of the stimulation should have been stronger? Although I understand the authors sought a long-term effect, such a measure could have proven useful to reveal at least an immediate day-to-day impact of stimulation and become a proof of their efficacy?

As this is not a standard rTMS stimulation device, some additional information on the stimulation source should be given to be able to compare the efficiency of low field pulsed magnetic stimulation with current human rTMS equipment. More specifically, what is the shape of the stimulating pulse (monophasic, biphasic?) and what is the rise time of the field? The pattern of stimulation used seems essentially an “excitatory” 10 Hz rTMS pattern, preceded and followed by short instances of ~6 Hz stimulation. Was this high frequency employed as a way to induce LTP phenomena in the hippocampus or as a tool to enhance cortical excitability and facilitate learning behavior leading then to functional and anatomical modulations of the hippocampus?

Navigation of the TMS coil of course could have been improved given the high-focality of the device used by the authors and the fact that any small head movements in a small rodent brain could easily lead to a completely different area of stimulation. It is true that prior studies in awake felines by our own group (see Valero-Cabré et al . 2006, Exp Brain , Valero-Cabre A et al. 2008, Eur J Neurosci. ) have used a similar manual procedure, but it is also the case that the coils and brains in those studies were larger and precise location on a specific region of the posterior parietal cortex was guided day to day by stereotaxic based measures and references. In many instances, we additionally benefited from parietal bone transparency during surgery, and identified in each animal the sulci/gyral pattern and labelled the exact area of interest (see Valero-Cabré et al . 2005 Exp Brain Res, Valero-Cabré et al .2007 Exp Brain Res ). Furthermore, in groups that were to be followed longitudinally, we placed a dental acrylic plug, that could be palpated through the skin of the scalp (see Afifi et al. 2012 Eur J Neurosci ) which was then used as consistent localization marker. The correct positioning of those plugs with regards to the stimulated areas was often verified pre-treatment by anatomical MRI methods and also in post-mortem brain dissections at the end of the follow up. In the current study, given the elongated shape of the hippocampus in rodents, which part of the rodent cortex or which stereotaxic level was aimed at during the stimulation? Also, in contrast with the quoted feline study, the authors indicate here that the coil was not in direct contact with the scalp. As air is a strong isolator, could that have attenuated the strength of such a low intensity field even further? Were Hall probe field measures in the hippocampus performed with the stimulating cell also separated from the scalp?",Edit suggestion_explicit,2-180_v2_19@3===nan;2-180_v2_19@4===nan;2-180_v2_19@5===nan,3
