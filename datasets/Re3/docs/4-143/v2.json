            "content": "Mild traumatic brain injury, commonly known as concussion, occurs frequently in children while playing sports. Whereas the negative impact of sport-related concussions on cognitive function is well known, the effects of concussions on sensorimotor function, especially in children, remain largely unknown. In this observational/case study, we investigated the association between neurocognitive function, assessed using a trail making test, and sensorimotor function, assessed using a visuomotor adaptation task, in three children who suffered from a concussion while playing sports. For the trail making test, children drew lines to connect numbers and letters alternately on a page. For the visuomotor adaptation task, children performed targeted reaching movements repeatedly under a novel visuomotor condition in which the visual display of reaching movements was rotated 30 degrees about the start position. Their neurocognitive and visuomotor performances were compared to those obtained from three children without a concussion. Results showed that only one of the three concussed children showed a score from the trail making test that was worse than the scores obtained from control subjects. However, the pattern of visuomotor adaptation observed in the concussed children was different from that observed in the control subjects in several ways. These data indicate that the concussed children may have some deficits in terms of their sensorimotor function as compared to the control subjects. Our findings provide preliminary data that suggest that children with concussion may have sensorimotor impairments even when they do not seem to have neurocognitive impairments.",

However, the association between pediatric concussion and sensorimotor function has not been investigated. Understanding motor learning impairment following sport-related concussion in children may be critical in guiding safe return to play. In this short observational/case study, we investigated the pattern of adaptation to a novel visuomotor condition in three children who suffered a concussion while playing sports, and compared their adaptation patterns to those obtained from three children without a concussion. A research paradigm in which individuals adapt to a novel visuomotor condition during reaching movements has been employed extensively in the neuroscience community to understand the neural processes that underlie motor learning in both adults <REF-4> , <REF-5> and children <REF-6> , <REF-7> .",

None of the three children had a concussion previously. They visited the Neuromechanics Laboratories at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM) 5~8 days following the concussion. Their symptoms were not assessed on the day they visited UWM, although one of the patients (cc1) was not able to speak or walk normally at that time. Three children (12 (cc1), 14 (cc3) and 17 (cc2) years old, all males), who were recruited from the Milwaukee Metropolitan area, served as controls. Selection criteria for subjects were the same for both patients and controls (except their concussion status), which were: subject was 10\u201317 years of age, regularly participated in an athletic activity, was English-speaking, was right handed, and had no neurological disease or peripheral disorder affecting movement of the right arm.

The baseline session (40 trials) was provided for the subjects to become familiarized with the general reaching task with unperturbed visual feedback. In the adaptation session (80 trials), the visual display of reaching movements was rotated 30 degrees counterclockwise about the start circle, such that a hand movement made in the \u201c12 o\u2019clock\u201d direction resulted in a cursor movement made in the \u201c11 o\u2019clock\u201d direction. Continuous visual feedback (in the form of a cursor) was provided throughout the movement in both sessions. A robotic exoskeleton called KINARM (BKIN Technologies Ltd, Kingston, ON, Canada) was used to provide the visuomotor rotation during the experiment and also to collect movement data. The 2-D position of arm segments was sampled at 1,000Hz, low-pass filtered at 15Hz, and differentiated to yield resultant velocity values. Data were processed and analyzed using MATLAB (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA) and SPSS.",

To obtain the second measure, a priori pairwise comparisons, using t-tests, were made between DE at block 8 from the baseline session and DE at each of the 16 blocks from the adaptation session (starting from block 1).

Third, age and sex were not matched perfectly between the patients and the controls tested in the present study. However, we are not aware of any findings that indicate significant differences between boys and girls within the age range of 12\u201317 years with regard to their visuomotor adaptation capabilities. In addition, it has been shown that during targeted reaching movements under a visuomotor rotation condition, visuomotor representations of children who were 6 or 8 years old differed from those of adults, although those of 11 year-old children did not <REF-12> . Our data do not seem to indicate sex-related differences either, in that the adaptation pattern of cc2 (15 year-old female) was very similar to that of ctls 1 and 3 (12 and 14 year-old males, respectively). Thus, while the potential effects of age- and sex-related differences between the patients and the controls cannot be completely excluded, it seems unlikely that our results were substantially influenced by such effects. Finally, we did not conduct statistical analyses to quantify the differences between the children with concussion and those without concussion, because the statistical results would not be very meaningful given the small sample size. Nevertheless, our data exhibited qualitative differences between the two groups of children that suggest sensorimotor deficits in concussed children. Further investigation is warranted to demonstrate quantitative differences between children with and children without concussion by utilizing a larger sample size.",

        "title": "Sensorimotor learning deficits observed in children with sports-related concussion",
        "abstract": "Mild traumatic brain injury, commonly known as concussion, occurs frequently in children while playing sports. Whereas the negative impact of sport-related concussions on cognitive function is well known, the effects of concussions on sensorimotor function, especially in children, remain largely unknown. In this observational/case study, we investigated the association between neurocognitive function, assessed using a trail making test, and sensorimotor function, assessed using a visuomotor adaptation task, in three children who suffered from a concussion while playing sports. For the trail making test, children drew lines to connect numbers and letters alternately on a page. For the visuomotor adaptation task, children performed targeted reaching movements repeatedly under a novel visuomotor condition in which the visual display of reaching movements was rotated 30 degrees about the start position. Their neurocognitive and visuomotor performances were compared to those obtained from three children without a concussion. Results showed that only one of the three concussed children showed a score from the trail making test that was worse than the scores obtained from control subjects. However, the pattern of visuomotor adaptation observed in the concussed children was different from that observed in the control subjects in several ways. These data indicate that the concussed children may have some deficits in terms of their sensorimotor function as compared to the control subjects. Our findings provide preliminary data that suggest that children with concussion may have sensorimotor impairments even when they do not seem to have neurocognitive impairments.",
