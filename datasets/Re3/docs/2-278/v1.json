He concludes that Bayesian calculations cannot be uncritically accepted when using uninformative priors. We argue that this conclusion is problematic because Efron's example on identical twins does not use data, hence it is not Bayesian statistics; his priors are not appropriate and are not uninformative; and using the available data point and an uninformative prior actually leads to a reasonable posterior distribution.",

Efron finds this probability to be 2/3 when using an uninformative prior versus 1/2 with an informative prior and thereby concludes that an uninformative prior does not have the desired neutral effects on the output of Bayes\u2019 rule. We argue that this example is not only flawed, but useless in illustrating Bayesian data analysis because it does not rely on any data. Although there is one data point (a couple is due to be parents of twin boys, and the twins are fraternal), Efron does not use it to update prior knowledge. Instead, Efron combines different pieces of expert knowledge from the doctor and genetics using Bayes\u2019 theorem. While certainly an impeccable probability law, Bayes\u2019 theorem is a mathematical equation, not a statistical model describing how data may be produced. In essence, Efron uses this equation to show that the value on the left side of the equation changes when a term on the right side is changed, which is trivial and could be shown with any mathematical equation also in a non-Bayesian context. Without new data, our knowledge is by definition determined by prior information; thus, showing that the outcome of a Bayesian analysis with no new data is heavily influenced by the prior would not argue against Bayesian methods. Indeed, without data, Efron\u2019s example is not Bayesian statistics and his conclusion about Bayesian statistics based on this example is unjustified.",

            "content": "We also have other more technical issues with Efron\u2019s example. Efron interprets the term P(A) on the right side of the equation (see sidebar in Efron 2013a <REF-1> ) as the prior on the probability that twins are identical. To make this prior uninformative, it is assigned a value of P(A) = 0.5 (see Efron 2013b <REF-2> ; although this is not stated in Efron 2013a <REF-1> ). This uninformative prior is set in contrast to the informative \u201cdoctor\u2019s prior\u201d of P(A) = 1/3. First, however, the parameter of interest is P(A|B) rather than P(A) according to Efron\u2019s study question (see sidebar in Efron 2013a <REF-1> ), thus the focus should be on the appropriate prior for P(A|B). Second, for the uninformative prior, Efron mentions erroneously that he used a uniform distribution between zero and one, which is clearly different from the value of 0.5 that was used. Third, we find it at least debatable whether a prior can be called an uninformative prior if it has a fixed value of 0.5 given without any measurement of uncertainty. For example, if we knew that our chance of winning the next million-dollar jackpot were 50:50, would we really call this uninformative?",

        "title": "Identical twins and Bayes' theorem in the 21st century",
        "abstract": "In a recent article in Science on \"Bayes' Theorem in the 21st Century\", Bradley Efron uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that twins are identical given that the sonogram shows twin boys. He concludes that Bayesian calculations cannot be uncritically accepted when using uninformative priors. We argue that this conclusion is problematic because Efron's example on identical twins does not use data, hence it is not Bayesian statistics; his priors are not appropriate and are not uninformative; and using the available data point and an uninformative prior actually leads to a reasonable posterior distribution.",
