Based on one of the other examples, however, Efron ultimately concludes that Bayesian analyses using uninformative priors cannot be uncritically accepted and should be checked by frequentist methods. While we wholeheartedly agree that statistical results should not be uncritically accepted, we find Efron\u2019s example ineffective in showing that Bayesian statistics require more careful checking than any other kind of statistics.",

We argue that this example is relatively useless in illustrating Bayesian data analysis. One reason is that Efron considers the particular set of twin boys as the entire population. In this case, statistics is not needed because there is no random sample drawn from a larger population. Rather, Efron combines different pieces of expert knowledge from the doctor and genetics using Bayes\u2019 theorem. While certainly an impeccable probability law, Bayes\u2019 theorem is a mathematical equation, not a statistical model describing how data may be produced. In essence, Efron uses this equation to show that the value on the left side of the equation changes when a term on the right side is changed, which is trivial and could be shown with any mathematical equation also in a non-Bayesian context.",

If we use the data point together with an uninformative uniform prior on P(A|B) (see Box 1 ) to determine the probability of identical twins given the twins are two boys, we obtain, with 95% certainty, a probability of between 0.01 and 0.84; if we use a highly informative prior based on information from the doctor and genetics, we obtain a probability of between 0.49 and 0.51. This looks completely reasonable to us, although of course we do not know much more than we knew before because we had only a single data point. We think that to illustrate the influence of non-informative priors on results of Bayesian data analyses, such an approach would be fairer than the calculations given by Efron.",

        "abstract": "In an article in Science on \"Bayes' Theorem in the 21st Century\", Bradley Efron uses Bayes' theorem to calculate the probability that twins are identical given that the sonogram shows twin boys. He concludes that Bayesian calculations cannot be uncritically accepted when using uninformative priors. While we agree that the choice of the prior is essential, we argue that the calculations on identical twins give a biased impression of the influence of uninformative priors in Bayesian data analyses.",
