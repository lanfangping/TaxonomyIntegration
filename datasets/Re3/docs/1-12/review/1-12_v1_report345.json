In this case it is not entirely clear how this fits into the model for translocation of proteins into the ER. A graphical explanation of the topology of this situation with the mDHFR fusion protein and how it can ensue would be helpful. This is important, as this part of the review is central to discounting the prominently proposed protein translocation at the PVM (REF 14).

For one of these proteins they found a signal peptidase-cleaved species that was retained in/at the ER. Despite an R->A mutation in the PEXEL (position 1) this protein was N-acetylated. Thus, in this case acetylation seemed independent of PEXEL mediated PI3P binding and PMV cleavage. As the signal peptide is usually cleaved during translocation, this could also indicate N-acetylation after ER entry. For the second protein, the PEXEL cleaved E->A mutation (position 5) was analysed. This protein was found in the PV despite being N-acetylated. This would even more strongly argue that protein entering the ER can still be acetylated. Finally, N-acetylation also occurred with the signal peptidase-cleaved mutated PfEMP3 trafficked to the PV (REF 9), a construct mentioned in this review as an example not entering the proposed pathway for export. These findings seem to be at odds with the proposed model.",

If I interpret the images from the episomally expressed constructs from REF 10 correctly, then the signal peptide mediates (and is sufficient for) PV targeting and thus also for ER entry. This would indicate a failure of ER retention rather than lack of ER targeting in the mutants lacking the transmembrane domain. The conclusion here that this data \u2018demonstrates that it is not a signal sequence\u2019 may therefore not be correct. It is also not clear why PMV would possess an N-terminal hydrophobic region at all if it is targeted by its C-terminal hydrophobic region (P. falciparum contains components for the insertion of tailanchored proteins which do not require a signal peptide).",

If N-acetylation in Plasmodium parasites is expected to strictly follow the current cell biological concepts from other systems, then this should equally be considered for the vesicle trafficking needed as a result of this (i.e. to make possible the export of a protein on the outer face of the ER). In particular this concerns how proteins get across the PVM. There is no tangible evidence for the presence of the components known to mediate vesicular trafficking (e.g. coats, SNAREs, rabs etc) beyond the parasite plasma membrane (absence of evidence of course is not necessarily evidence for absence, but in contrast many classical components in anterograde and retrograde vesicular trafficking seem to be present within the parasite, see e.g. Deponte et al., MBP 2012). How the vesicle trafficking necessary to suit the model is achieved may therefore be a similarly (or even more) enigmatic cell biological problem than how proteins could be acetylated within the ER.",

Or, at least as a formal possibility, can it be entirely excluded that the observed N-acetylation of processed PEXEL proteins is non-physiological and occurs during affinity purification of these proteins from parasite extracts?
