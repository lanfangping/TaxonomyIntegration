It is what is done today in a student practicum.- The homology model (structure of subunit \u03b1, Supplementary Figure 3) is a homology model based on a model (this was NO real structure), which basically also means, one could just take 4 random alpha helices and put them together in a bundle. - The authors should mention in the methods section which genes from F o were amplified by PCR.- Supplementary material figure 1: The window ledge and the arm of the photographer is visible on the picture.- Supplementary material figure 2: The quality of the left EM micrograph is poor, the picture is not in focus. The picture on the right side is distorted, I cannot see anything there.- Page 5 line 1: The Cook lab did not use Bacillus pseudofirmus OF4 but rather Bacillus TA2.A1- Figure 2 and Figure 3: The alignment should contain Bacillus TA2 because the authors refer to it in the text on Reference 25 (McMillan et al. ). - Figures 2 and 3 appear to be very similar. It may have made more sense to include all the information in one figure to avoid redundancies and save space.",
