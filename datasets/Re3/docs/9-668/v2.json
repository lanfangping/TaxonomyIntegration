Recently, new dermatologic findings have been described in association with the disease that can potentially be a distinguishing feature of infection. One such feature resembles chilblains <REF-1> . Chilblains-like lesions, described in multiple case reports from around the globe, have demonstrated either an erythematous-edematous or blistering skin lesion that mostly affects the toes and soles. Over the course of one to two weeks, lesions become more purpuric and flatten, finally resolving spontaneously without any treatment. The majority of patients with chilblains-like lesions are generally in good health, without significant coronavirus symptoms, may have a recent history of mild upper respiratory symptoms, but no prior history of similar cutaneous lesions <REF-2> . By contrast, non-COVID-19-related chilblains are associated with exposure to low temperatures and may be associated with autoimmune disorders (chilblain lupus), hematologic disorders and rarely viral infections. During recent months, chilblains-like lesions has been reported in association with COVID-19, although the timing of these lesions relative to active infection appears to vary. In a cohort of patients reported from Italy, some patients developed skin findings only during the initial course of disease, while others reported onset at later stages <REF-3> .",

Due to potentially unreliable and subjective patient reporting, lack of awareness that these lesions may be a symptom of COVID-19 disease, and limited coronavirus testing availability, the diagnosis of COVID-19 and/or chilblains-like lesions may be missed or unreported. Based on our experience with the COVID-19 population in Oregon, we hypothesize that there may be a limited and possibly non-overlapping diagnostic window for COVID-19 infection and chilblains-like lesions. If true, this could result in classic chilblains-like lesions features in the absence of a positive COVID-19 diagnostic test. Here, we present the case of a 48-year-old healthy woman, who presented with chilblains-like lesions on her toes and tested as negative for COVID-19.",

She had no other underlying diseases and denied recent exposure to cold temperatures. She is a healthcare provider with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2. The patient reported upper respiratory symptoms four weeks prior to development of lesions, which included mild sore throat, non-productive cough, and chest pain. A viral test was unavailable at that time. Her highest temperature was 99.4\u00b0F. Concurrent with the onset of cutaneous manifestations, she and her husband both experienced intermittent diarrhea over a period of 3 days without any recurrent respiratory symptoms or fever. Two 9-year old children in the home were asymptomatic. The patient began developing small blisters on both her feet, starting with a single, isolated lesion on the bottom of one toe. Additional lesions developed on the lateral aspects and top of 6 toes, primarily at the distal aspect. The cutaneous lesions slowly progressed from pink macules and papules to violaceous lesions with surrounding pink erythema ( Figure 1 ).",

No thrombi were seen. Superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with extravasated red cells were also present with a final pathologic diagnosis of chilblains/perniosis, consistent with those seen in COVID-associated chilblains-like lesions (\u201cCOVID-toes\u201d).

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, typically presents with symptoms including fever, cough, headache, myalgia, asthenia, anosmia, diarrhea, and sometimes pneumonia, which can be fatal. Recently, new dermatologic findings have been described in association with the disease that can potentially be a distinguishing feature of infection. One such feature resembles chilblains and this case report represents a presentation of this feature with a 48-year-old female with violaceous lesions with surrounding pink erythema on her toes who tested negative for COVID-19.",
