This needs to be clarified.\n- In figure 5, did the authors use a reference protein to ensure that the same total protein content was used for each band? If so, this should be included as a reference in Figure 5.\n- In the discussion section, the authors mention that curcumin in different preparations can present with varying effects. Since curcumin is a pure substance isolated from Curcuma longa, it will have the same chemical properties and therefore \u2013 given that it is properly dissolved like in this study using DMSO in non-toxic concentrations \u2013 then it should not be different from any other study. If the authors refer to a Curcuma longa extract then it would be a different issue worth discussing.\n- Furthermore, and of great importance, the authors briefly mention the low bioavailability of curcumin in vivo in humans \u2013 how does that compare to the concentrations that were used in these experiments? What would be a good comparison blood concentration one could expect in humans after oral application of curcumin? This should be included in the discussion section to provide the reader with some perspective.",
