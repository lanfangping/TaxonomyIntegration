Their study demonstrates that curcumin is a potent inhibitor of IL1\u00df-induced PGE2, MMP3 and GAG release from cartilage at non-toxic concentrations. I found this article very interesting to read as it highlights important aspects of practical relevance for research on curcumin activity in cartilage. I do have a few remarks that might help to somewhat improve the manuscript.",
