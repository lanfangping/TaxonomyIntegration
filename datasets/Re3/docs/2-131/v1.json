OCT is useful in monitoring and evaluating retinal thickness in many retinal disorders. One example is Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), a progressive, blinding disease that is mostly Non-Neovascular (NNV-AMD) but can be associated with choroidal Neovascularization (NV-AMD). Currently, OCT is also being employed as an outcome measure in many multicenter clinical trials of AMD with Time Domain OCT (TD-OCT) devices being the most common <REF-1> , <REF-2> . Spectral Domain OCT (SD-OCT) is a newer technology that obtains high-resolution scans of the retina.",

For NV-AMD, the FTH values for the central 1 mm were 375 \u00b5m (+129 \u00b5m), 253 \u00b5m (+74 \u00b5m), 312 \u00b5m (+110 \u00b5m) for Spectralis\u2122, Stratus\u2122, and Cirrus\u2122 respectively.

On the other hand, the FTH values for NNV-AND in the central 1 mm before correction were 298 \u00b5m (+87 \u00b5m), 193 \u00b5m (+32 \u00b5m), and 229 \u00b5m (+30 \u00b5m) for Spectralis\u2122, Stratus\u2122, and Cirrus\u2122 respectively. Spectralis\u2122 was the only device to have a different FTH value (248 \u00b5m +56 \u00b5m) after correction. Overall, Spectralis\u2122 had the highest retinal thickness values (range: 280 to 372 \u00b5m), depending on the subfield. The retinal thickness measurements obtained via Cirrus\u2122 were slightly less (range: 230 to 320 \u00b5m), while Stratus\u2122 had the lowest values, ranging from 190 to 270 \u00b5m.

            "content": "The advent of OCT has revolutionized the way patients with retinal disorders are evaluated and monitored. However, like every new device, the current devices employing time- or spectral domain technology have certain limitations. One such common and clinically relevant issue is the presence of random errors in the identification of the inner and outer boundaries of the retina by the OCT algorithm. With respect to AMD, studies have shown that lesions such as fibrotic scars, choroidal neovascularization disrupting the RPE, and subretinal fluid would produce errors in the automated segmentation algorithms because the software would not correctly delineate the outer retinal boundary <REF-3> , <REF-5> . In our study, we found that 66% of the Spectralis\u2122, 14% of the Cirrus\u2122 and 6.5% of the Stratus\u2122 scans had algorithm errors. Giani et al. reported similar results; for Cirrus\u2122, they reported 25% and 16% algorithm error rates for NNV-AMD and NV-AMD, respectively. However, for Spectralis\u2122, they reported 16.67% and 57.6% algorithm error rates and 8.33% and 62.5% rates for Stratus\u2122 for NNV-AMD and NV-AMD, respectively <REF-5> . Other studies have reported Stratus\u2122 outer boundary algorithm errors of approximately 43% for both forms of AMD and 60% for NV-AMD <REF-3> , <REF-6> .",

Rather than having an exact definition of an algorithm error, which may not be clinically significant <REF-5> , in our study, the decision was made by two masked observers who determined if the correction would be important. In addition, even though Spectralis\u2122 segments the outer border of the RPE, a study by Jaffe et al. reported that it may also be including the Bruch\u2019s membrane in its calculation, thus including sub-RPE pathology such as drusen when segmenting the outer border of the retina <REF-7> . These differences may be due to the fact that our study was prospective and, while acquiring scans, the operators tried their best to ensure no errors occurred during scan acquisition. Lastly, we did not exclude scans if the signal strength was low or if the machine gave a low analysis confidence message, as other studies have done <REF-8> \u2013 <REF-10> .",

This may be due to the fact that the majority of the scans required minor corrections. For example, most of the Spectralis\u2122 scans resulted in a 10 \u00b5m or less change in the central subfield thickness. Retinal thickness measurements were similar in both SD-OCT machines and were greater than Stratus\u2122. Correction reduced the difference of the thickness measurements between the two SD-OCT devices to less than 20 \u00b5m; in some cases as noted above, the difference was no longer statistically significant. Other studies in normal and pathologic eyes including Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) and macular degeneration have also demonstrated that the difference in retinal thickness between the SD machines can be attributed to the differences in segmentation of the automated algorithms <REF-7> , <REF-10> , <REF-11> .",

The COR of Cirrus\u2122 was equal to or larger than Stratus\u2122 for both forms of the disease. In all three devices, the COR was generally better for NNV-AMD when compared to NV-AMD, especially after correction. This difference between diseases can be attributed to the pathology of NV-AMD disrupting the outer border, which makes it difficult for the automated algorithm to accurately segment the retinal layers <REF-12> , <REF-13> . At this point, we are not aware of any previous study looking at the repeatability of Spectralis\u2122 images in AMD. Previous studies on normal eyes have reported a high repeatability of measurements with Spectralis\u2122, with differences between repeated measurements being within 1 \u00b5m <REF-11> , <REF-14> . For Stratus\u2122 OCT images, other studies have found central subfield repeatability values in patients with NV-AMD to be 50 \u00b5m and 32\u201335 \u00b5m for NNV-AMD patients after correction/exclusion of scans with errors <REF-8> , <REF-15> ; our study confirms this finding. There has been one other published study looking at the repeatability of Cirrus\u2122 OCT in NV-AMD, which found a central subfield repeatability value of 42 \u00b5m before correction and 27 \u00b5m after exclusion <REF-16> . The difference between this study and our measurements may be associated with our smaller sample size.

While no previous studies have reported ICC values for AMD patients, Pierro et al. found comparable results in normal eyes, with Cirrus\u2122 ICC values ranging from 83\u201397% and Stratus\u2122 ICC values from 72\u201395% <REF-17> . The most likely reason for the low repeatability and high ICC values for Spectralis\u2122 is the eye-tracking capability, which ensures that artifacts due to eye movement are minimized and the machine scans only when the tracking software identifies the same position on the fundus <REF-14> .",

The mean difference between machines indicates that the lowest differences were between Spectralis\u2122 and Cirrus\u2122, especially after correction. This is mostly likely due to the effects of manually correcting the Spectralis\u2122 images and the fact that both machines have similar scanning technologies. The limits of agreement were similarly very wide for all three machines, and were narrower after correction of images, especially for the two SD-OCT machines. Jaffe et al. reported similar results looking at NV-AMD, with limits of agreements being approximately 225 \u00b5m between a SD-OCT and TD-OCT <REF-7> .

Also, because of the wide Bland-Altman 95% intervals, there is not much agreement between the SD-OCT and TD-OCT machines. Based on our findings, we recommend that scans be carefully analyzed at reading centers before the thickness values are accepted as reliable.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the reproducibility and reliability of Optical Coherence Tomography scans (OCT) obtained using the Time Domain (TD-OCT) StratusTM OCT, and the Spectral Domain (SD-OCT) SpectralisTM and CirrusTM OCT devices before and after manual correction in eyes with either Neovascular (NV-AMD) or Non-Neovascular (NNV-AMD) Age-related Macular Degeneration. Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study of 36 patients (50 eyes) with NV-AMD or NNV-AMD at a university-based retina practice. OCT scans were taken simultaneously using one TD-OCT and two SD-OCT devices. Macular thickness measurements were assessed before and after correction of the OCT algorithm by constructing Bland-Altman plots for agreement and calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and coefficients of repeatability (COR) to evaluate intraclass repeatability. Results: The Spectralis device had the highest number of images needing manual correction. All machines had high ICCs, with Spectralis having the highest. Bland-Altman plots indicated that there was low agreement between both Cirrus\u2122 and Stratus\u2122 and Spectralis\u2122 and Stratus\u2122, while there was good agreement between the Cirrus\u2122 and Spectralis\u2122 devices. The CORs were lowest for SpectralisTM and similar with each other and had higher values for CirrusTM and StratusTM. Agreement, CORs, and ICCs generally improved after manual correction, but only minimally. Conclusion: Agreement is low between devices, except between both SD-OCT machines. Manual correction tends to improve results.",
