The paper introduces a dataset targeted at computational argumentation, more specifically at implicit assumptions which are often involved in premises supporting arguments. Such implicit assumptions, labelled as \u201chuman values\u201d in the paper and in the social sciences, are shared beliefs regarding the positive assessment of some dimension, e.g., \u201chaving a comfortable life is good\u201d, \u201cbeing polite is good\u201d, etc. The dataset released with the paper contains 5270 English arguments annotated with a 54-level taxonomy of human values, which is  organized hierarchically and covers four geographical cultures (USA, China, India, Africa). The release is complemented by modeling experiments which set the baseline for future work on the data.\nThe main strengths of the paper are in 1) the novelty of the dataset and the fine-grained taxonomy it adopts, 2) the interdisciplinary nature of the adopted taxonomy, and 3) the size and coverage (for the U.S. part).  The main weaknesses are 1) the cursory description of the annotation schema, 2) the need for a more detailed discussion of the modeling results (what works, what doesn\u2019t), 3) the lack of ground for cross-cultural generalization which is claimed as a contribution.  For these reasons, I consider the paper good but, acceptance-wise, I am not fully convinced by in its current version. I recommend the authors address the points summarized above and discussed below, and I look forward to read the next version of the paper, either as a resubmission or in its final version if it is accepted.",

E.g., care in moral foundation theory, Benevolence: caring in the dataset).  - Modeling: BERT is multi-label, SVM multi-class. Can the authors elaborate on how this (paired with the skewed frequency coming with the high-granular dataset) affects the modeling?  - Conceptually: Human values are a phenomenon that has its own standing independently from argumentation. They are expected to vary across social groups, geographical locations, etc. The authors should probably acknowledge this explicitly, and I think they could make their motivation/contribution even stronger by reflecting on the gain of both sides of this interdisciplinary study. Human values can of huge interest for computational argumentation (main motivation of the paper). But what is the specific perspective/contribution that the focus on argumentative text can give on the study of human values?",
