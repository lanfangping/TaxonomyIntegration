            "content": "Polymorphisms in the T cell (or transmembrane) immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 ( TIM-1 ) gene, particularly in the mucin domain, have been associated with atopy and allergic diseases in mice and human. Genetic- and antibody-mediated studies revealed that Tim-1 functions as a positive regulator of Th2 responses, while certain antibodies to Tim-1 can exacerbate or reduce allergic lung inflammation. Tim-1 can also positively regulate the function of B cells, NKT cells, dendritic cells and mast cells. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which Tim-1 modulates immune cell function are currently unknown. In this study, we have focused on defining Tim-1-mediated signaling pathways that enhance mast cell activation through the high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI). Using a Tim-1 mouse model lacking the mucin domain (Tim-1 Dmucin ), we show for the first time that the polymorphic Tim-1 mucin region is dispensable for normal mast cell activation. We further show that Tim-4 cross-linking of Tim-1 enhances select signaling pathways downstream of FceRI in mast cells, including mTOR-dependent signaling, leading to increased cytokine production but without affecting degranulation.",

Tim-1 has an N-terminal IgV domain, a mucin-like domain with multiple potential sites for O-linked glycosylation, followed by a stalk domain with potential N-linked glycosylation sites, a transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Tim-1 was initially identified as a cellular receptor for hepatitis A virus (HAVCR1) <REF-1> . The TIM-1 gene was positionally cloned from a locus on the same chromosome but distinct from the IL-4 gene cluster that is commonly associated with Th2-biased immune responses <REF-2> . Polymorphisms in murine Tim-1 are associated with susceptibility to airway hyper-reactivity (AHR), a hallmark of asthma, and increased Th2 cytokine production <REF-2> . Similarly, polymorphisms in human TIM-1 have been linked to atopic diseases including asthma, allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis <REF-3> . The atopy connection is particularly intriguing since genetic variations in human TIM-1 modify susceptibility or resistance to allergy, but only in individuals sero-positive for HAV <REF-4> . These findings suggested that Tim-1 has a role in regulation of immune responses to atopic diseases.",

Antibodies recognizing distinct epitopes of Tim-1 either enhanced or attenuated lung inflammation <REF-7> . We further showed that ectopic expression of Tim-1 in T cells stimulated in vitro under \u201cneutral\u201d conditions promoted generation of more IL-4- rather than INF-\u03b3 production <REF-6> . Tim-1 can also enhance NFAT/AP-1-dependent transcription in T cells activated by TCR crosslinking, suggesting that Tim-1 functions as a co-stimulatory molecule for T cell activation <REF-8> . Similarly, co-stimulatory function of Tim-1 was also observed after interaction of Tim-1 with its ligand Tim-4, which is primarily expressed on APCs <REF-9> , <REF-10> .",

Administration of the agonistic Tim-1 antibody 3B3 induces expression of early activation markers CD69 and CD25 as well as IL-2 production <REF-8> . Other groups have demonstrated that ligation of Tim-1 by Tim-4 can activate the ERK/MAPK pathway and enhance T cell survival by up-regulating the anti-apoptotic protein BcL-x L <REF-9> . Additional studies revealed that Tim-1 could co-cap with CD3 on human T cells <REF-11> . Tim-1 ligation on T cells has also been reported to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the linker for activation of T cells (LAT) and the TCR-proximal Syk family tyrosine kinase Zap70 <REF-9> .

They have the capacity to secrete a multitude of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors that regulate allergic inflammation, pathogen defense, and anti-tumor immunity <REF-17> . Given the genetic and functional connection of Tim-1 to allergy and hypersensitivity and the sentinel role of mast cells in atopy, it is important to determine how Tim-1 signaling contributes to the high affinity Fc receptor for IgE (Fc\u03b5RI)-mediated mast cell activation. Here we demonstrate that Tim-1 promotes NF-\u03baB and NFAT/AP1 transcriptional activation, leading to enhanced IL-6 promoter activation and cytokine production in IgE/Ag-stimulated mast cells. Using BMMCs generated from a mouse strain lacking the Tim-1 mucin domain (Tim1 \u0394mucin ), we show that this co-stimulatory effect is independent of the Tim-1 mucin domain. Finally, we show that Tim-1, in contrast with Tim-3, acts more distal to Fc\u03b5RI to enhance S6 activation, without affecting proximal Fc\u03b5RI signaling. Overall, our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the co-stimulatory effects of Tim-1 signaling on Fc\u03b5RI-mediated mast cell activation.",

Tim-1 cross-linking by Tim4-Fc was shown to enhance cytokine production in a dose-dependent manner without affecting degranulation <REF-16> . We first confirmed that Tim4-Fc could bind to our cultures of bone marrow derived mast cells (BMMC) from C57BL/6 mice ( Figure 1A ). We observed similar effects of Tim4-mediated IL-6 production in IgE/Ag-stimulated BMMCs ( Figure 1B ). In addition, we quantified the degranulation response by measuring beta-hexosaminidase release as well as with a flow cytometry-based assay that tracks both Annexin V binding to exposed PS and loss of Lysotracker staining, due to granule release (AnnexinV+Lysotracker lo ). The latter method has the advantage of a high signal-to-noise ratio, and as such has been a robust assay for evaluating IgE/Ag-stimulated mast cell degranulation <REF-18> . Thus, we showed that varying the concentration of Tim-4, along with suboptimal antigen concentration to observe potential co-stimulation, did not have an effect on the immediate degranulation response ( Figure 1C\u2013D ). These results suggest that Tim-1 ligation by Tim-4 can exert differential effects on the immediate degranulation response, vs. late-phase cytokine production.",

Specifically, low antigen concentration or valency will activate only positive Fc\u03b5RI signaling pathways, while high antigen valency or concentration will preferentially engage negative signaling components downstream of Fc\u03b5RI. This is due to activity of the Src family kinase Lyn as a positive and/or negative regulator of Fc\u03b5RI signaling at low or high antigen valency, respectively <REF-19> . We stimulated BMMCs with low (DNP 5 -BSA) or high (DNP 32 -HSA) potency antigens in the presence of Tim4-Fc or isotype control and assessed whether Tim-1 ligation could contribute to receptor signaling intensity. Thus, at high antigen valency, which also activates negative feedback of antigen receptor signaling, Tim-4 was able to maintain high IL-6 production but not at low antigen valency that induces robust antigen receptor signaling ( Figure 1E\u2013F ). Specifically, increasing the amount of Tim-4 further promoted cytokine secretion under high valency antigen stimulation, i.e. under conditions where the negative signaling loop is triggered. To exclude the possibility that Fc\u03b3 receptor binding may interfere with Tim1-Tim4 interaction, we compared IL-6 release by BMMCs, with or without addition of Fc blocking antibody, and found no differences, at least at the concentration of Tim4-Fc used throughout this study (5 \u03bcg/ml). These findings indicate that Tim-1 ligation can modulate the intensity of the antigen-induced positive Fc\u03b5RI signaling pathways and may be able to bypass the negative feedback signaling loop controlled by Lyn.",

Specifically, mAbs 1H8 and 3A2 bind to distinct epitopes near an N-linked glycosylation site in the stalk region and have agonistic and antagonistic activity, respectively. The mAb 4A2 binds to the IgV domain of Tim-1 and reduces lung inflammation and pathology <REF-7> . However, aside from 4G8, we did not detect significant binding of these antibodies to BALB/c Tim-1.

This co-stimulatory activity was dependent on tyrosine 276 in the Tim-1 cytoplasmic tail <REF-6> . Similarly, ectopic expression of an N-terminal FLAG-tagged Tim-1 on MC/9 mast cells was able to enhance IgE/Ag-stimulated NF-\u03baB transcriptional activation ( Figure 3A ). This enhancement was abrogated when the cytoplasmic tail of Tim-1 was deleted or when a tyrosine-phenylalanine mutant (Y276F) was used ( Figure 3A ). Polymorphisms in Tim-1 have been associated with differential responses to OVA-induced allergic asthma <REF-2> . We found that both isoforms of Tim-1 (BL/6 and BALB/c) could significantly enhance activation of an NF-\u03baB transcriptional reporter to a comparable extent ( Figure 3B ). Consistent with findings in T cells and effects on mast cell cytokine production, transient expression of Tim-1 also up-regulated NF-AT/AP1 and IL-6 promoter activation, in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner ( Figure 3C\u2013D ). Furthermore, using IL-6 promoter deletion constructs, we showed that Tim-1 mediated enhancement of transcriptional activation and subsequent production of IL-6 through activation of NF-\u03baB and AP-1 transcription factors ( Figure 3E ). Unlike Tim-4 crosslinking of Tim-1, addition of anti-FLAG antibody could not further promote reporter activity, suggesting either that Tim-1 may have other ligands on MC/9 mast cells or that Tim-1 can homo-dimerize after ectopic expression, via its heavily glycosylated mucin domain, leading to downstream signaling.",

            "content": "Our findings thus far suggest that the Tim1-Tim4 interaction augments Fc\u03b5RI signaling itself, rather than acting through a parallel pathway, since Tim-4 treatment alone does not induce any detectable cytokine production or degranulation. While the Tim1-Tim4 interaction has been attributed primarily to the IgV domain, Tim-4 has also been proposed to bind to the Tim-1 mucin domain <REF-10> . Intriguingly, the genetic linkage of Tim-1 to allergies and asthma is associated with polymorphisms in the mucin domain. Using a mutant mouse lacking only the Tim-1 mucin domain (Tim-1 \u0394mucin ) <REF-21> , we determined whether the Tim-1 mucin domain is necessary to relay the co-stimulatory effects of Tim-4 binding. We noted no obvious defects in mast cell development or maturation, when BMMC were generated from Tim-1 \u0394mucin bone marrow. Thus, WT and Tim-1 \u0394mucin BMMCs expressed comparable levels of surface Tim-1, based on staining with IgV-binding Tim-1 antibodies ( Figure 4A ). Tim-1 \u0394mucin BMMCs exhibited a similar extent of degranulation in response to antigen stimulation, compared to WT BMMCs, which was not altered by Tim-1 ligation ( Figure 4B\u2013C ). Next, we examined the ability of Tim-1 \u0394mucin BMMCs to secrete cytokines in response to IgE/Ag. Tim-1 \u0394mucin mast cells appeared to respond normally to antigen stimulation, and also to Tim4-mediated co-stimulation ( Figure 4D ). Using different batches of BMMCs over the course of multiple experiments, we were not able to consistently observe any major difference between WT and Tim-1 \u0394mucin BMMCs. We did observe some variation in the amount of IL-6 produced by different batches of BMMCs, but this appeared to be largely due to the relative maturation status of the cells ( Figure 4E\u2013H ). These results indicated that the mucin domain of Tim-1 is not required for normal mast cell responses and also that Tim-4-mediated mast cell activation does not appear to involve the mucin domain of Tim-1, but rather its IgV domain.",

            "content": "Next, we assessed the potential signaling pathways utilized by Tim1-Tim4 interaction downstream of Fc\u03b5RI signaling to upregulate mast cell cytokine production. Using a Nur77GFP reporter mouse, we previously showed that unlike the related family member Tim-3, engagement of Tim-1 did not enhance Fc\u03b5RI signal intensity, thereby showing that Tim-1 cross-linking does not augment antigen receptor-proximal signaling <REF-18> . We moved on to explore signaling pathways both proximal and distal to the Fc\u03b5RI complex, for any effects of Tim-1. Thus, the Zap70-related kinase Syk is an Fc\u03b5RI\u03b3-associated activator integral to activation of LAT, SLP76, PLC-\u03b3 and other adaptor molecules essential for signal transduction downstream of Fc\u03b5RI <REF-22> . Phosphorylation of Syk was not further increased by Tim-4 ( Figure 5A ). Similarly, we observed robust phosphorylation of ERK and Akt upon IgE/Ag-induced activation that was not affected by Tim-1 engagement ( Figure 5B and data not shown). These results demonstrate that MEK/ERK and PI3K/Akt pathways are not involved in enhancement of Ag-mediated mast cell function by Tim-1, even though we observed that phosphorylation of Tim-1 cytoplasmic tail by TCR activation led to recruitment of p85 subunit of PI3K <REF-8> . Nevertheless, we did detect a significant increase in phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6, an important target of the PI3K/mTOR pathway regulating cell growth, survival, metabolism, and protein synthesis in mast cells <REF-23> . Mast cells exhibited robust phosphorylation of S6 (~80% of BMMCs) one hour post-Ag stimulation, which did not increase further with Tim-4 addition. However, Tim-4 treatment was able to maintain a significant percentage of pS6-positive BMMCs for as long as four hours, even as the Ag-triggered signal returned to basal levels ( Figure 5C ). Overall, these results support a positive role of Tim-1 activation by Tim-4 to sustain mTOR-dependent mast cell metabolism and protein synthesis, leading to enhanced cytokine production.",

Here we demonstrate that Tim-1 is a positive regulator of mast cell activation and cytokine production. Similar to our findings on the effects of Tim-3 on mast cells <REF-18> , ectopic expression of Tim-1 expression was sufficient to promote IgE/Ag-mediated NF-\u03baB and NF-AT/AP1 transcriptional activation (at least in MC/9 cells), without additional cross-linking antibodies or exogenous ligands. Tim-4 is a ligand for Tim-1, but the lack of Tim-4 expression on mast cells makes it an unlikely explanation for this particular role of Tim1 in mast cells. Tim-1 can also bind PS on apoptotic cells <REF-24> or PS transiently exposed on degranulating mast cells, either of which could potentially contribute to enhance Tim-1 signaling, although whether PS binding to Tim-1 can lead to mast cell activation is still unknown. Tim-1 has also been reported to bind LMIR5/CD300b, an activating receptor expressed on myeloid cells <REF-25> . Stimulation with Tim1-Fc was able to induce LMIR5-mediated ERK activation in mast cells, suggesting that LMIR5 is an endogenous ligand of Tim-1, driving the enhancement of transcriptional response. Finally, Tim-1 may homodimerize through its glycosylated mucin-like domain, leading to downstream signaling and function. We showed that Tim-1 co-stimulation is dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation motif in its cytoplasmic tail, as mutation of tyrosine 276 rendered Tim-1 unable to mediate co-stimulation. The Src kinase Fyn has been shown to phosphorylate Tim-1 in a B cell line <REF-26> . We showed that the Tim-1 cytoplasmic tail is phosphorylated upon TCR stimulation in an Lck-dependent manner and can recruit p85 binding <REF-8> . Therefore, Src family kinases like Lyn, Fyn or Hck are potential facilitators of Tim-1 phosphorylation upon IgE/Ag activation in mast cells.",

Unlike in T cells or in vivo experiments, mast cells did not respond to Tim-1 antibody treatment, as none of the antibodies tested elicited a change in mast cell degranulation or cytokine production. On the other hand, Tim-4 treatment consistently enhanced IgE/Ag-mediated cytokine production but not degranulation, which may be a time- and/or signal intensity-dependent effect. Tim-4 was reported to have bimodal effects, either enhancing or inhibiting T cell proliferation, depending on anti-CD3/CD28 concentrations <REF-10> . This bimodal regulation was later reported to inhibit activation of na\u00efve T cells, which do not express Tim-1, and to enhance activation of effector T cells, suggesting that Tim-4 binds to an unknown ligand expressed preferentially on na\u00efve T cells <REF-27> . In addition, Tim-4 can bind to na\u00efve T cells that do not express Tim-1 and inhibit Th17 differentiation <REF-28> . This effect was shown to be independent of Tim-1 activity, since addition of Tim-1 blocking antibody, presumably to block the Tim1:Tim4 interaction, could not rescue Tim4-mediated inhibition <REF-28> . In contrast to such ligand-dependent effects observed on T cells, Tim-4 co-stimulates IgE/Ag-mediated mast cell activation by cross-linking Tim-1. Using low and high valency antigens to engage the positive and negative signaling pathways of Fc\u03b5RI, respectively, we showed that Tim-4 could enhance mast cell cytokine production in both settings. Specifically, Tim-4 co-stimulated cytokine release in a dose-dependent manner, under both high and low valency antigen stimulation. These results imply that Tim-4 contributes to Fc\u03b5RI signaling intensity and/or duration, and may potentially override negative feedback signals linked primarily to Lyn-mediated phosphatase activation. Together with findings that Tim-4 alone does not induce cytokine production in mast cells, our results demonstrate that Tim-1 signaling interfaces with common effector molecules downstream of Fc\u03b5RI signaling, rather than acting through a parallel pathway, to enhance mast cell functions.",

Furthermore, two separate strains of Tim-1-deficient mice showed relatively unaltered IgE production and AHR development in an OVA-induced mouse model of asthma, although one study did note higher type 2 and Th17 cytokine production in Tim-1 knockout (KO) mice <REF-26> , <REF-29> . On the other hand, the importance of the Tim-1 mucin domain has been demonstrated in T cell activation, differentiation, trafficking, and effector function in autoimmunity and airway inflammation <REF-28> , <REF-30> . The mucin domain of Tim-1 is also essential for homeostasis and function of regulatory B cells <REF-14> , <REF-15> , <REF-21> . Thus, we examined whether the Tim-1 mucin domain regulates mast cell activity, particularly in the context of Tim-4 treatment. Contrary to the effects seen in B and T cells, the mucin domain was dispensable for the effects of Tim-1 in mast cells, as degranulation and cytokine release were intact in the absence of the mucin domain. It is worth noting that Tim-1 \u0394mucin BMMCs were actually able to secrete more cytokine than WT BMMCs in some instances. However, this was not a consistent finding. While our study focused on bone marrow-derived mast cells, absence of the Tim-1 mucin domain may nonetheless affect the differentiation and/or function of other mast cell types in their respective tissue microenvironments in vivo . Tim1-Tim4 interactions are thought to occur mostly through their respective IgV domains, although there is evidence that Tim-4 may also bind to the Tim-1 mucin domain <REF-10> . We showed that Tim-4 mediated co-stimulation of mast cell function occurred independent of the Tim-1 mucin domain. It remains to be determined, in the absence of the Tim-1 mucin domain, whether Tim-4 has other unknown ligands on mast cells that can mediate this enhancement.",

This is consistent with our finding that the Tim1-Tim4 interaction did not alter Ag-stimulated Fc\u03b5RI signaling intensity, using mast cells from a Nur77 GFP mouse model <REF-18> . Syk is phosphorylated on multiple tyrosines by either auto-phosphorylation or trans-phosphorylation by Lyn, resulting in enhancement or inhibition, respectively, of Ag-mediated Fc\u03b5RI signaling <REF-31> \u2013 <REF-33> . Since we only examined tyrosines 519 and 520 in the Syk activation loop, which are sites of Syk auto-phosphorylation, it is possible that other tyrosine phosphorylation sites of phosphorylation may be affected by Tim-1. One particular site of interest is tyrosine 346 in the linker region, which is important for PLC-\u03b31 binding and phosphorylation <REF-34> . Aside from positive signaling pathways, the relevant negative signaling pathways should be investigated for potential down-regulation by Tim-1 engagement. In particular, Src homology-2-containing signaling protein (SHIP), which has been implicated in regulation of IgE/Ag-induced IL-6 production through inhibition of NF-\u03baB activity, both of which are enhanced by Tim-1 cross-linking in our study <REF-35> .",

These effects were not observed in a previous study on mast cells, with either BMMC\u2019s or peritoneal mast cells (PMCs) <REF-16> . Similarly, we did not observe effects of soluble Tim-4 on these signaling pathways, in conjunction with Ag-mediated Fc\u03b5RI aggregation. It is possible that Tim-4 signals are cell-type specific or that mast cells require more robust aggregation of Tim-1 at the time of antigen stimulation to induce substantial effects. While phosphorylation of Akt was not detectably affected, phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 was significantly enhanced upon Tim-4 treatment, an effect that correlated with enhanced cytokine production. Ribosomal protein S6 is a downstream effector of PI3K/mTOR signaling, and as such is essential for mast cell survival, proliferation, metabolism and protein synthesis. MALT1 and BCL10, members of the Carma1-MALT1-Bcl10 (CBM) complex, are essential regulators of Fc\u03b5RI-induced mast cell activation by selectively up-regulating NF-\u03baB-dependent cytokine production without affecting degranulation and leukotriene synthesis <REF-36> . We previously identified a Carma1-MALT1-dependent activation of mTOR signaling after TCR engagement, leading to phosphorylation of S6 and another mTOR substrate 4E-BP1 <REF-37> . Thus, Tim-1 may preferentially engage the MALT1-Bcl10 pathway to modulate mTOR signaling and NF-\u03baB responses without affecting Fc\u03b5RI-proximal signaling. Consequently, further studies are needed to address whether Tim1-Tim4 interaction promotes mast cell metabolic responses and protein synthesis as well as whether the specific Tim-1 targets in this pathway leading to effector functions.",

        "abstract": "Polymorphisms in the T cell (or transmembrane) immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 ( TIM-1 ) gene, particularly in the mucin domain, have been associated with atopy and allergic diseases in mice and human. Genetic- and antibody-mediated studies revealed that Tim-1 functions as a positive regulator of Th2 responses, while certain antibodies to Tim-1 can exacerbate or reduce allergic lung inflammation. Tim-1 can also positively regulate the function of B cells, NKT cells, dendritic cells and mast cells. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which Tim-1 modulates immune cell function are currently unknown. In this study, we have focused on defining Tim-1-mediated signaling pathways that enhance mast cell activation through the high affinity IgE receptor (FceRI). Using a Tim-1 mouse model lacking the mucin domain (Tim-1 Dmucin ), we show for the first time that the polymorphic Tim-1 mucin region is dispensable for normal mast cell activation. We further show that Tim-4 cross-linking of Tim-1 enhances select signaling pathways downstream of FceRI in mast cells, including mTOR-dependent signaling, leading to increased cytokine production but without affecting degranulation.",
