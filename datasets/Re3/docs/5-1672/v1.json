            "content": "This paper explores the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of a new concept of health. Investigations into the nature of health have led to a new definition that explains health as a complex adaptive system (CAS) and is based on five components (a-e). Humans like all biological creatures must satisfactorily respond to (a) the demands of life. For this purpose they need (b) a biologically given potential (BGP) and (c) a personally acquired potential (PAP). These properties of individuals are embedded within (d) social and (e) environmental determinants of health. Between these five components of health there are 10 complex interactions that justify health to be viewed as a CAS. In each patient, the current state of his health as a CAS evolved from the past, will move forward to a new future, and has to be analyzed and treated as an autonomous whole. A diagnostic procedure is suggested as follows: together with the patient, the five components and 10 complex interactions are assessed. This may help the patient to better understand his situation and to recognize possible next steps that may be useful for him to evolve toward more health by himself. In this process mutual trust in the patient-physician interaction is critical. The described approach offers new possibilities to help patients to improve their health.",

            "content": "Citizens consult their physicians when they feel that something is not in order, e.g. when they experience pain, fatigue or any other disorder. Physicians then examine them and specifically look for pathological changes. After investigation they make a provisional diagnosis and explore their patients further or treat them accordingly. This type of thinking goes back to the pathologist Rudolf Virchow, who in 1858 used 20 lectures to describe \u201ccellular pathology\u201d, a characterization of different diseases <REF-1> . Although the foundations of medicine have vastly changed since then, the general principles of medical practice have remained the same. Only over the past 20 years, complexity science has gradually entered into medicine <REF-2> , <REF-3> . This has become particularly important for the interpretation of health and disease as different states of a complex adaptive system (CAS). The Meikirch model is a new definition of health that exhibits all the features of a CAS <REF-4> . For such systems the concepts based on Virchow\u2019s pathology are no longer appropriate. An understanding of health and disease now requires appreciation of complexity science. It introduces a new dimension for diagnosing and treating patients. It includes the potential to improve health in a way that hitherto was practiced only exceptionally. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the relevant features of the Meikirch model and to reveal in detail how the model and complexity science may be applied for a better understanding of a patient\u2019s disease and for its treatment.",

It can take up material and energy from the environment (input), release end products (output, e.g. entropy) and do work. Within the system there are many different parts called agents. In Figure 2 they are symbolized as circles. They continuously and autonomously interact with each other in a nonlinear manner, contributing to the product, the so called emergence of the CAS. The term emergence indicates a new and often unpredictable quality which is more than the sum of the functions of each part. A CAS always functions as a whole. Attractors are sites to which the energy flow of the system may be drawn. A CAS is equipped with a learning and bonus arrangement for the interactions among its agents. This gives it the possibility to adapt to changes in the environment, i.e. to learn. If for some reason this adaptation functions poorly, the CAS suffers. If it does not function at all the CAS becomes chaotic and goes into a crisis or vanishes. Repeated critical disturbances may lead to the so called butterfly effect <REF-2> . Examples of medical conditions are ventricular fibrillation, epileptic seizures, tantrum, or psychotic states. Every CAS has evolved from a prior condition and autonomously progresses toward an unforeseeable future state. A CAS may be part of a larger CAS or be composed of many CASs. Such structures are called nested CASs.",

This then passes through the stages of embryo and foetus to the maturity needed for birth. At some time during intrauterine life the personality of the individual is created. At the least, physicians and midwifes say that in the new-born it is clearly recognizable. From then on the complete Meikirch model is fully operational during all phases of the life course of each person. Thus evolution from birth to death demonstrates clearly how many adaptive processes occur as part of the different complex interactions described by the model. While the two potentials evolve, the demands of life, the social, and the environmental determinants also vary. Within these limiting and supporting contexts individuals follow an autonomously chosen life course. Under such conditions it is not surprizing that some adaptations may not be fully successful for some time or permanently. Challenging examples are malnutrition, infectious diseases, love deprivation, sexual maturation, pregnancy, genetic defects, professional stress, the raising of children, physical involution, aging, etc. Such changes may lead an individual as a system into a state of crisis. If it is minor, the two potentials still may manage the demands of life and the difficulties may resolve spontaneously after some time. Such situations are not considered to represent a disease. Yet, they may evolve into a chronic state that draws energy from the person and thereby may explain e.g. insomnia, chronic fatigue, or somatoform symptoms. If the defect gets more severe it may lead to a disease that requires more medical attention. In the Meikirch model the term disease implies that for any reason one or several adaptation processes are not successful enough to empower the two potentials to satisfy the demands of life.",

Examples for the former are minor acute infections or tension headaches, and for the latter, overweight, type 2 diabetes, or arterial hypertension.\n- 2. A more relevant disturbance of the system leads it into a crisis, i.e. it becomes \u201cchaotic\u201d. Such states may e.g. be corrected spontaneously, or by behavioural changes, or by interacting with a physician or healer, by medications, or by operations. Thereafter there may not be an immediate complete recovery to health. The full adaptive evolution may take time and further interventions that are called convalescence or rehabilitation may be needed. These phenomena may lead to complete healing or to healing with defects.\n- 3. If a CAS is disturbed continuously for a prolonged time, the CAS apparently is not able to satisfactorily respond to the demands of life. This represents a chronic disease or invalidity. If the condition is progressive and serious, it may lead to death. Examples are rheumatic or degenerative diseases and different types of neoplasms.\n- 4. Considering a disturbed state of health as a maladapted CAS implies that patients cannot simply be healed by the actions of a competent physician. Healing much rather is the result of a process of self-reorganization, enabling the two potentials to again satisfactorily fulfil the demands of life. The task of physicians and other health professionals therefore consists in being competent advisors and fellow human beings that assist the patient to realize the necessary evolution himself.",

In this case the five components and the ten complex interactions of the Meikirch model are assessed by an extended history as exemplified in Box 3 . A thorough analysis will give the patient a new way to look at his health and how he has led his life. He will discover aspects he did not think about before, and this may be of therapeutic value. At the same time the physician may start to interpret the patient\u2019s history and findings in a new way. He may discover further possibilities for helping the patient to autonomously evolve to a new state which hopefully comes closer to health.",

It must be assisted to reorganize itself autonomously to a new state, in order to better fulfil the demands of life, hence better health and well-being. Therefore the role of the physician is to accompany the patient during the process he goes through. Some advice, assistance, or therapeutic intervention may be helpful, but only the patient is in a position to create his new future state for himself. By analysing his condition as a CAS together with his physician including all components and all interactions of the model he presumably receives many new ideas that he can use to emerge to a healthier state in the future. For example, he may want to make up his mind whether or not he will accept all the conditions that have determined his life in the past. In this respect, a discussion with his physician of alternatives with their consequences may be useful. For many patients it might be constructive to deal with the energy flow in their system, e.g. to speak about the purpose of their lives.",

Yet, until now much of health care has not been concerned with an understanding of the nature of health; it used instead an intuitive notion of wellbeing which did not lead to new insights. In contrast, a rational understanding of health - as given by the Meikirch model - offers innovative opportunities. Today this model is better founded on scientific evidence than other definitions of health. Its ultimate validity, however, will be documented only by using it in practice. This must be done with due consideration to the special features of the model. Much further research is urgently needed.",

They are based, however, predominantly on materialism and neglect the social and spiritual features of the human nature. In addition, until recently medicine has not considered systems theory. It appears that these two aspects offer new opportunities for health care to become even more effective. Systems thinking implies that science based on Newton must be complemented by complexity science. Particularly for the purpose of health care a phenomenological, narrative, evolutionary holism must be added to analytical reductionism <REF-11> . Poorly functioning parts are not simply corrected by appropriate drugs or surgical operations. Instead considerations of the evolution of the patient\u2019s health to the present state, earlier successes in self-management and failures in the handling of his present crises can be evaluated. Antonovsky\u2019s sense of coherence and meaningfulness also may be very helpful <REF-12> . Necessary changes a patient has to realize must not come top-down from the physician, but rather bottom-up, originating in the patient himself, e.g. by new insights. For this purpose mutually trusting patient-physician interactions are critical for a successful future: the physician must believe in the patient\u2019s abilities to evolve to a new state and must accompany and support him with loving wisdom in this endeavour.",

In many difficult situations they often had to accompany rather than to treat them. Such patients remained very loyal because they understood what their doctor had contributed to their health. At the same time physicians realized that they had nothing more to offer than their personal support as a professional human being. The Meikirch model offers now a rational approach to such difficult cases and it is hoped that it will give new opportunities for patients to move toward better health. At the first glance the described system\u2019s approach to patient care is similar to what Michael Balint intended with his groups <REF-13> . He was psychiatrist and pursued the purpose to train general practitioners in psychotherapy. In contrast, the systems theory focusses on a new look at a patient\u2019s possible unresolved evolutionary steps, analyses the biological given and personally acquired potentials and offers him an opportunity to progress further in his personal biography. More research is needed to validate the promises and limitations of this approach.",

The latter is the resource that continuously pilots the adjustment to new life situations. It is the locus of executive functions <REF-14> . For this purpose it interacts with all components of the system. The PAP is the seat of memory, visions, fantasy, reasoning, attentional control and inhibitory control, and problem solving. Its sustained evolution toward more and more wisdom is critical for the maintenance of health. The PAP can learn to compensate in part for losses of the BGP. This leads to an interesting aspect of the relationship between the two potentials. It may be compared to rider and horse. If the rider wants that his horse serves him well he has to take good care of his horse. It appears that the neglect of the PAP in modern medicine is well perceived by patients. Therefore they turn to complementary or alternative medicine. In fact, much of the success of homeopathy and other methods might be explained by the physician patient interaction with its effects on the complex adaptive system that expresses the patient\u2019s health. This mechanism may be relevant also for much of the success of other complementary or alternative treatments. It is our opinion, however, that it will be better to work with the CAS in a planned and scientifically justifiable manner based on the Meikirch model than to apply unproven methods. The model would also serve as an excellent framework for a proper practice of evidence based medicine as defined by David L. Sackett: \u201cEvidence-based medicine (EBM) requires the integration of the best research evidence with our clinical expertise and our patient\u2019s unique values and circumstances <REF-15> .\u201d This applies also to the newly evolving holistic clinical approach \u201cIntegrative Medicine and Health\u201d that \u201creaffirms the importance of the relationship between practitioner and patient, focuses on the whole person, is informed by evidence, and makes use of all appropriate therapeutic and lifestyle approaches, healthcare professionals and disciplines to achieve optimal health\u201d <REF-16> .",

        "title": "Health as a Complex Adaptive System: a new dimension of patient care in internal medicine and general practice",
        "abstract": "This paper explores the diagnostic and therapeutic potential of a new concept of health. Investigations into the nature of health have led to a new definition that explains health as a complex adaptive system (CAS) and is based on five components (a-e). Humans like all biological creatures must satisfactorily respond to (a) the demands of life. For this purpose they need (b) a biologically given potential (BGP) and (c) a personally acquired potential (PAP). These properties of individuals are embedded within (d) social and (e) environmental determinants of health. Between these five components of health there are 10 complex interactions that justify health to be viewed as a CAS. In each patient, the current state of his health as a CAS evolved from the past, will move forward to a new future, and has to be analyzed and treated as an autonomous whole. A diagnostic procedure is suggested as follows: together with the patient, the five components and 10 complex interactions are assessed. This may help the patient to better understand his situation and to recognize possible next steps that may be useful for him to evolve toward more health by himself. In this process mutual trust in the patient-physician interaction is critical. The described approach offers new possibilities to help patients to improve their health.",
