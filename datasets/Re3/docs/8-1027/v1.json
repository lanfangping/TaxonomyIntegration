            "content": "However, there are significant limitations in the sole reliance on rating scales for making clinical decisions. First, well-established clinical cut-offs are not available for many of these measures to designate when the level of these traits is severe and impairing enough to warrant a diagnosis <REF-21> , <REF-24> . Second, as is the case for all forms of psychopathology in children <REF-25> , ratings of CU traits from different informants often show only modest levels of agreement <REF-26> . This lack of correspondence across different sources of information makes it a challenge for clinicians to know how best to integrate these discrepant reports when making diagnoses <REF-27> . Third, a number of biases, both intentional (e.g., deception) and unintentional (e.g., social desirability), can influence ratings of CU traits that need to be considered when making clinical decisions and such sources of bias are often difficult to determine from questionnaires <REF-27> \u2013 <REF-29> . Fourth, it appears that the optimum assessment of CU traits that detects the construct across all levels of severity requires the use of both positively worded items in which affirmative response denotes more callous and unemotional behaviours (e.g., \u201cdo you seem cold and uncaring to others\u201d), as well as negatively worded items in which an affirmative response denotes lower levels of the construct (e.g., \u201cdo you feel bad or guilty when you do something wrong\u201d; <REF-30> ). However, negatively worded items can sometimes be difficult to understand and put a strain on a child\u2019s verbal abilities, which are often found to be deficient in children with conduct problems, anyway <REF-31> . Thus, when making clinical decisions, it is important that items are accurately understood by those providing information. A final issue with existing rating scale measures of CU traits is that they were not developed specifically to assess the criteria for the LPE specifier included in the DSM-5 and ICD-11, which further complicates their use for making the diagnosis <REF-21> .",

The CAPE 1.1 was designed specifically to assess the four symptoms of the LPE specifier now included in the DSM 5: lack of guilt/remorse, callousness and lack of empathy, unconcern about performance, and shallow or deficient affect. The CAPE 1.1 uses the structured professional judgement approach to assessment. That is, very explicit descriptions of the four symptoms are provided and experienced clinicians rate the children on each symptom using a three-point scale (0=not at all descriptive; 1=somewhat descriptive; 2=definitely descriptive) based on all sources of information. The manual has descriptions of prototypical behaviour for each of the four items to aid the interviewer in making their ratings. Also, the CAPE 1.1 is explicitly designed to not rely on any single source of information and it provides a semi-structured interview format to aid the clinician in obtaining information from the child, parents, and other informants. These interviews start with stem questions directly related to the items being rated (e.g., \u201cDoes ________ seem to care and be concerned about the feelings of others?\u201d). The clinician follows up by asking for examples to ensure that the informant understood the question and by asking other questions (e.g., \u201cIs this how he is most of the time and with most people\u201d) to aid in scoring. The semi-structured format allows the interviewer to probe and ask for as many examples as needed. The final ratings are only made by considering all sources of information and, to conform to DSM-5 criteria, a diagnosis is made when two or more items are scored as being \u201cvery descriptive\u201d (the maximum score of 2) of the child.",

However, to date, there has been no published data testing the validity of this method. Thus, we investigated the validity of the CAPE 1.1 in a group of socially disadvantaged families that are part of the \u2018Troubled Families Scheme\u2019 - implemented by the UK government in 2010. Children who show serious conduct problems tend to come from high-risk backgrounds involving disorganized, unmotivated or disadvantaged families <REF-33> , and the scheme provides early intervention for these behaviour problems facilitated by local county councils. The scheme targets families in which parents experience unemployment, their children fail to attend school, and where family members are involved (or at risk of being involved) in drug use and/or other criminal activity. The stated aim is to break the cycle of disadvantage that leads to antisocial behaviour across generations. In the current study, we examined the relations among the CAPE 1.1 item scores and criterion-related measures with well-validated questionnaires of CU traits and psychopathic traits in a sample of families in the Troubled Families Scheme. We also validated the CAPE 1.1 with construct-validity measures of offending, and violence from case file records. We examined the relation between the CAPE 1.1 ratings and well-validated questionnaire measures of externalizing (conduct problems) and internalizing behaviours as well as impact of symptoms on daily living. Finally, we examined the validity of the diagnostic cut-off used by the CAPE 1.1 to determine clinical levels of CU traits, as specified in the DSM-5 criteria for the LPE specifier. We decided not to confound the validation measures with CAPE 1.1 ratings, so ratings were solely based on the semi-structured interview.",

For two children below the age of 7 and for a child with a diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder, only the parent interview was conducted. While the CAPE 1.1 is designed to use all sources of information available to the clinician, including semi-structured interviews, rating scales, and file review, the scoring in the current study was based solely on the interviews, so that rating scales and file information could be used to test the validity of the CAPE 1.1 scores.

The first author is trained in psychometric assessments within clinical settings and has completed a PhD that involved carrying out psychoeducational and mental health assessments within a community clinic, special education provision, and juvenile justice services under the supervision of a licensed clinical psychologist in the USA.

Second, we examined the prevalence and validity of the diagnostic threshold used by the CAPE 1.1 to approximate the Limited Prosocial Emotions specifier, as defined in the DSM 5 <REF-8> , which defines those with the diagnosis as persons with 2 or more symptoms rated as 2.",

The SDQ is a 25-item scale that assesses five domains of adjustment including Hyperactivity, Conduct Problems, Emotional Symptoms, Peer Problems, and Prosocial Behavior. Generally, the SDQ was found to be a reliable and valid measure of conduct problems and has been widely used in both community and clinical samples of children and adolescents <REF-37> . A three-subscale division has been recommended by Goodman et al. <REF-38> consisting of externalizing behaviour, internalizing behaviour and the prosocial scale. Externalizing behaviour was assessed by combining the Hyperactivity and Conduct Problems sub-scales, on both a parent (\u03b1 = 0.89) and child (\u03b1 = 0.75) version. Internalizing behaviour was also assessed using the child (\u03b1 = 0.48) and parent (\u03b1 = 0.76) versions, combining Emotional Symptoms and Peer Problems. The prosocial scale was utilized as part of the University of New South Wales (UNSW) CU Traits measure (see below). In addition, part of the extended version of the SDQ, the impact supplement was used to assess further chronicity, social impairment, distress and burden to others <REF-39> . This is a scale, based on parent-reports, that sums items about impact on free time and leisure, home activities, and school activities, as well as distress caused by symptoms.",

Children targeted for the intervention were higher than their siblings (non-target children) in parent-reported psychopathic traits on the CPTI ( t (62.20)= -3.14, p = 0 .003 , d = -0.72), and this included all subscales: callous/unemotional ( t (68.25)= -2.25, p = 0 .027 , d = -0.51), grandiosity/deception ( t (56.50)= -2.96, p = 0.005 , d = -0.69), and impulsivity/need for stimulation subscale ( t (70.08)= -2.64, p = 0.010 , d = -0.60).

Those children diagnosed with the LPE specifier were found to have higher CU traits according to the UNSW parent report ( t (31)= -3.02, p = 0.005, d = -1.29) and higher psychopathic traits ( t (32)= -2.32, p = 0.027, d = -0.99) according to the CPTI total \u2013 specifically, they were higher on the grandiosity/deception subscale ( t (32)= -2.84, p = 0.008, d = -1.20) and the CU subscale ( t (32)= -2.32, p = 0.027, d = -0.99). However, the two groups did not differ on the impulsivity/need for stimulation subscale of the CPTI ( t (32)= -0.84, p = 0.408, d = -0.36) or any of the other measures. With regard to case file records, children meeting the criteria for the LPE specifier did not differ, from those not meeting criteria, on risk for violence or for contact with young offending services (X 2 (1, N = 32) = 1.52, p = .217; X 2 (1, N = 32) = 0.96, p = 0.327, respectively). Of note, no girls met criteria for the LPE specifier.",

When using this cut-off, those who scored above the diagnostic threshold were higher on parent ratings of CU traits and also ratings of grandiosity and deceptiveness, which are part of the interpersonal psychopathic traits. However, this group did not differ on the other measures of externalizing behaviour or risk for violence. There are two possible reasons for this finding. First, the cut-off led to only 7 children in the sample meeting the diagnostic criteria, leading to very low power for detecting group differences. Second, the use of a high-risk sample meant that even those who were not elevated on CU traits likely showed significant problems in adjustment.",

This signifies that the prototypical presentation of low empathy, lack of guilt, lack of concern and shallow affect was associated with greater problems in adjustment across reporter-based measures but also case file records. Additionally, the greater number of areas where children showed this prototypicality were even more related to maladjustment. Further research with larger samples and with more diversity of problem behaviours is required to determine if the diagnostic cut-off is useful for this tool.",

Clinical uses will become increasingly common now that CU traits are included in the diagnostic classification systems used globally. Further, as interventions are developed and tested to specifically target the needs of children and adolescents with elevated CU traits <REF-52> , their success will rely on adequate assessment, especially in samples who experience social disadvantage, behaviour problems, poor school attendance, and who show behaviours that are generally difficult to access. Further, in such samples, clinical judgement will be important to ensure that reporters understand the questions and are able to provide information in a way that is appropriate for their cultural and educational background. Specifically, the CAPE 1.1 requires clinicians to gain examples from the informants in their own words, to ensure that the questions are understood and answered in the way that is intended.",

This finding suggests that scores from the CAPE 1.1 can be used as a continuous measure of CU traits as well. Further, three of the four items differentiated those who scored above the diagnostic criterion from those who did not. Specifically, the frequency at which the item \u201cunconcerned about performance\u201d was rated as being at the symptom level (i.e., a score of 2 or \u201cvery descriptive\u201d) was similar for children who did and did not meet the diagnostic criteria for LPE. The small sample leading to a limited number of children meeting criteria for the specifier, again suggests that this finding should be replicated in other samples. However, it does point to the need to evaluate the relative utility of the symptoms used to define the LPE specifier <REF-50> .",

First, as noted previously, the sample size led to a very small number of children meeting the criteria for the LPE specifier and thus, there was limited power of the tests comparing those meeting and those not meeting the diagnostic threshold for the LPE specifier. The small sample also prevented us from testing potential moderators of the validity of CAPE 1.1. Of particular note, we could not test potential differences that might have been found in the validity of the CAPE 1.1 across age or sex of the child. Second, we only used parent and child reports from semi-structured interviews to score the CAPE 1.1; we did not have access to teachers as potential informants. Also, because we wanted to use behaviour ratings and case files to test the validity of the CAPE 1.1 scores, clinicians were not allowed to use this information in their ratings. Thus, clinicians were not able to use \u201call sources of available information\u201d, as recommended by the CAPE 1.1 manual <REF-32> . Third, although the researchers carrying out the CAPE 1.1 had a sufficient level of training to do so (as previously outlined), they would not meet the criteria to make clinical decisions from its use relative to what is recommended in the manual. However, as the CAPE 1.1 was carried out solely for research purposes, rather than diagnostic purposes, that level of training was not necessary. Fourth, because of the training required and the method of obtaining information that relies on collecting multiple sources of information, the CAPE 1.1 is a much more time consuming and expensive method for assessing CU traits when compared to behaviour rating scales. While we have argued that this could be beneficial for many clinical uses, it will be important for future research to test whether the scores from the CAPE 1.1 provide important information over and above that provided by rating scales that would justify the cost.",

As a result, the CAPE 1.1 could provide a method for making important clinical decisions for children and adolescents who are at risk for a particularly severe and chronic pattern of conduct problems, for whom careful treatment planning is essential.",

        "abstract": "Background: Callous-unemotional (CU) traits are important for designating a distinct subgroup of children and adolescents with behaviour problems. As a result, CU traits are now used to form the specifier \u201cwith Limited Prosocial Emotions\u201d that is part of the diagnostic criteria for the Conduct Disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 th Edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Diseases 11 th Revision (ICD-11). Given this inclusion in major classification systems, it is important to develop and test methods for assessing these traits that can be used in clinical settings. The present study aimed to validate a clinician rating of CU traits, the Clinical Assessment of Prosocial Emotions, Version 1.1 (CAPE 1.1), in a sample of hard-to-reach families referred to a government program designed to prevent the development of behaviour problems in high risk families. Methods: Clinical ratings of children were obtained from 34 families of children ages 3 to 19 (M=12.2; SD=4.3). The ratings on the CAPE 1.1 were based on interviews with both parent and child. Results : Of the sample, 21% (100% male) met the diagnostic cut-off for the specifier according to the CAPE 1.1, and CAPE 1.1 scores were associated with parent ratings of CU traits, psychopathic traits, and externalising behaviours. CAPE 1.1 ratings were also associated with risk for violence obtained from case files. Conclusions: These findings provide preliminary evidence for the validity of the CAPE 1.1 as clinician rated measure of CU traits.",
