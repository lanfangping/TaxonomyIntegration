Studies have shown that promoting positive mental health, not only reduces the prevalence and incidence of mental disorders, but also affects the process of treatment and reduces related burden. However, this concept has different interpretations in different cultures, and in many societies, mental health is still considered the absence of mental illness. Thus, the present study was conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of Iranian adults` perspective towards the concept of positive mental health.",

Based on the results obtained in a study by Keyes et al. , complete mental health is a function of two interrelated independent entities, with positive mental health (PMH) as one axis, and the absence of mental disorder as the other <REF-1> \u2013 <REF-3> . The complete mental health approach covers previous approaches such as the pathogenic approach, which defines mental health as the absence of mental disorders, and the salutogenic approach, that focuses on the positive aspects of human abilities and functioning in emotions and behaviors <REF-1> .",

In fact, the concept of PMH includes personal capabilities in psychological, emotional, and social dimensions and promoting PMH leads to a reduction in psychological disorders, a decrease in the probability of all-cause mortality, prevention of suicidal behaviors, and impairment in academic performance <REF-9> \u2013 <REF-12> .

PMH is formed by the combination of these two approaches, and is conceptualized by the presence of emotional, psychological, and social well-being <REF-15> . Since this concept is affected by demographic, biological, cultural, socioeconomic and psychological factors etc. <REF-16> , <REF-17> , it occurs very differently in different countries. For instance, the high level of PMH (flourishing) is 11.6% in South Korea, but 76.9% in Canada <REF-18> . A study conducted by Nosratabadi on Iranian students showed that 16% of students were classified as flourishing <REF-19> , and a study by Joshanloo et al. reported the level of PMH among Iranian students was lower than those in the Netherlands and South Africa <REF-20> . Understanding and determining the concept of PMH based on cultural-social differences is essential for promoting PMH and preventing psychological disorders. Furthermore, no study has yet addressed this subject in Iranian culture. Therefore, it was decided to conduct a qualitative study to carefully explore the concept of PMH and its domains in the Iranian society.",

The locations for group discussions were chosen by interviewees (workplace, tailor shop, municipality health home etc.). In each FGD, first the moderator (corresponding author) introduced herself and her colleague (note taker) and explained the study objectives. A guide questionnaire was used to conduct and direct FGDs. This guide questionnaire had been designed by the research team members using a review of the literature and then validated by group discussion with experts ( Supplementary File 1 ). After the introduction, FGD began with a general question \u201cWhat characteristics do you think a person with mental health has? Please explain\u201d. Then, the FGD continued with other questions such as\u201d In your opinion does mental health have any domains?\u201d The concept of PMH and its domains were also asked and debated. During discussions, participants were encouraged to express openly about their opinions and experiences, and probing words such as where, when, how, why, etc. were used to ensure proper understanding of concepts referred to by participants, with the intention of exploring new concepts. The FGD ended when no new topics were expressed.",

It seems that spirituality is a notable way of obtaining wellbeing and there is a widespread belief that people with spiritual beliefs and faith have better mental wellbeing <REF-31> , <REF-32> . Although religiosity is considered as a main variable in defining PMH, Ganga and his challenge showed that people with different religions experience diverse level of PMH <REF-30> . It is important to realize more about interpersonal variations. Previous studies have shown that the most common mechanisms through which religion promotes well-being include social support networks, coping resources and positive emotions <REF-33> , <REF-34> . The spiritual dimension also increases creativity, patience, hope and vitality through communication and coping strategies <REF-35> .",

In fact, stress coping mechanisms are not only important as factors affecting PMH, but also as PMH outcomes <REF-38> . Studies showed there is a strong relationship between financial management and satisfaction, and mental wellbeing <REF-39> .

Furthermore, a proper understating of how mental health professionals conceptualize the concept of PMH is essential in policy making and implementing proper community-based interventions in order to promote and protect mental health.",

        "title": "Positive Mental Health from the perspective of Iranian society: A qualitative study",
        "abstract": "Background : According to the World Health Organization, mental health relates, not only to the absence of mental disorder, but also to Positive Mental Health. Studies have shown that promoting positive mental health, not only reduces the prevalence and incidence of mental disorders, but also affects the process of treatment and reduces related burden. However, this concept has different interpretations in different cultures, and in many societies, mental health is still considered the absence of mental illness. Thus, the present study was conducted to provide an in-depth understanding of Iranian adults` perspective towards the concept of positive mental health. Materials and Methods : In the present qualitative study, eight focus group discussions (6 to 8 adults in each session) were held consisting of 30 to 60 year-old men and women from Tehran. Data were analyzed in \"DeDoose\" qualitative software using content analysis. Results : According to the data obtained, participants found no difference between positive mental health and mental health, mostly equating it to the absence of mental disorders and having positive energy, peace in and satisfaction with life. According to the results, positive mental health has four domains of emotional/psychological, spiritual, social, and life skills. Conclusion : Understanding an individual\u2019s positive mental health concepts culturally and providing appropriate community based programs can significantly promote the mental health of the community.",
