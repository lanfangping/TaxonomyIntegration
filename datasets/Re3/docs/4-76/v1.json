However, institutional support for Teaching-Focussed academics is often limited, both in terms of peer networking and opportunities for career development. As four early-career stage Teaching-Focussed academics working in a variety of institutions, we explore what motivated our choices to make teaching our primary academic activity, and the challenges that we have faced in doing so. In addition to highlighting the need for universities to fully recognise the achievements of teaching staff, we discuss the role that the various biosciences learned societies have in supporting Teaching-Focussed academics. We identify that there is a need for the learned societies to come together and pool their expertise in this area. The fragmented nature of the Teaching-Focussed academic community means that clear sources of national support are needed in order to best enable the next generation of bioscience educators to reach their full potential.",

            "content": "There are 1.8 million undergraduates studying in UK universities, with Biological Sciences students accounting for 10.3% of the undergraduate population ( The Higher Education Statistics Agency, HESA, 2013 ). Students place a high value on teaching quality; scores for overall satisfaction in the National Student Survey are most strongly correlated with the scores for quality of learning and teaching ( Buckley, 2012 ). Undergraduates expect that their experience of higher education represents value for money, and want to be taught in small-scale classes by experienced and qualified teaching staff ( Kandiko & Mawer, 2013 ). Providing high quality teaching is a therefore a significant component of Biology departments, many of whom rely on Teaching-Focussed academics to deliver aspects of their undergraduate programmes. At the Society for Experimental Biology (SEB) Education Meeting in December 2014, a major theme that emerged was the challenges facing those at the early stages of their teaching careers. Many of the difficulties faced by Teaching-Focussed academics have been well documented ( Cashmore & Ramsden, 2009 ; Cashmore et al. , 2013 ; Locke, 2014 ; Young, 2006 ). Here we present our experiences as early-career teaching orientated academics in a range of UK Higher Education (HE) institutions to explore both the challenges and opportunities of working in teaching roles.",

The HESA includes Teaching-Focussed academics in their surveys of academic staff (note that the HESA uses the term Teaching-Only), revealing that those on Teaching-Focussed contracts represent around 25% of all academic staff, rising to 50% of staff in pre-1992 universities that are not members of the Russell Group ( HESA, 2013 ; Locke, 2014 ). The employment profiles of Teaching-Focussed academics are significantly different to those on Teaching and Research or research-only contracts. There are roughly equal proportions of male (48%) and female (51%) Teaching-Focussed academics, contrasting with Teaching and Research where there is a gender bias (60% male). Teaching-Focussed roles are primarily filled by academics on part time, fixed term contracts; only 18% have a full time open ended contract, compared with 74.5% of those on Teaching and Research contracts (see Figure 1 ). While 12% of academic staff are on zero-hours contracts, this number rises to 47% of Teaching-Focussed staff ( University and College Union, 2013 ). A large proportion of those with responsibility for delivering undergraduate programmes therefore have limited job security. This is perhaps symptomatic of a wider conflict within HE teaching; universities are relying on Teaching-Focussed contracts to fulfil their teaching requirements, yet at an institutional level there is often little support for those in Teaching-Focussed roles to become established members of the academic community.",

Our enthusiasm for understanding learning and teaching makes us an intellectual and practical asset for colleagues whose research dominates their time.

Teaching is influenced by differing drivers from research, which may result in early-career teachers having reduced choice in setting the scope of their activities compared to their research equivalents. The teaching agenda is often set by more senior staff, leaving less flexibility for early-career individuals to teach the subjects that they find the most intellectually stimulating. Funding for teaching is more restricted and less transparently advertised than research fellowships and grants, leaving those on Teaching-Focussed contracts at a disadvantage when external funding success is a promotion criterion. Teaching outputs may also not be transferrable between institutions due to copyright ownership issues, therefore making sharing good practice and demonstrating impact more difficult than for equivalent research outputs.",

Unlike research which has a well-defined (though not necessarily flawless) path to lectureship, currently there appears to be no clear route to a teaching dominant academic role in the sciences within most UK academic institutions, although some have created Teaching-Focussed career paths (e.g. University of Bristol). Most advertised teaching fellow positions require a PhD and teaching experience, but the opportunities to gain teaching experience and/or training during a PhD or post-doctoral position are mixed and often limited, with supervisors prioritising the publication of papers over the development of non-research skills. For those combining teaching and research at early career stages, teaching commitments mean that it may not be possible to achieve the same quantity or impact of research publications, creating a barrier to progressing to the more prevalent research-teaching posts or returning to research-only positions. In contrast, research staff retain the opportunity to move sideways to teaching at any stage in their career because the importance of demonstrating high-impact teaching, and recruiting on that basis, is not yet universally recognised ( High Level Group on the Modernisation of Higher Education, 2013 ).",

This means that we have to look further afield to find a group of peers with whom we can discuss pedagogical concepts and their applications, compared to our research-focussed colleagues. The vocabulary and style of pedagogical literature can be quite different than that of bioscience, and the lack of immediate peers can make engaging with the literature more challenging. Not only does this make current research harder to interpret and implement, but it acts as a hurdle to preparing manuscripts when authors are less clear about the expectations of journal editors and their audience; something which we experienced ourselves when writing this paper. These factors can lead to a feeling of isolation amongst Teaching-Focussed academics, which several of us have experienced during our careers (see case studies) and which can be frustrating and demoralising.",

Recently though, and particularly with the changes to student finance in England and Wales, reward and recognition for teaching and related activities has been put under the spotlight across the HE sector ( Cashmore & Ramsden, 2009 ; Cashmore et al. , 2013 ). The Academy of Medical Sciences, The Physiological Society, Heads of University Biosciences and the Society of Biology recently published a survey of over 250 bioscience academics from a range of institutions, career stages and contract types ( Academy of Medical Sciences et al. , 2014 ). Only 57% of respondents reported that their institution has a clear strategy for evaluating staff teaching contributions. Furthermore, 55% of respondents indicated scepticism that teaching is considered equally to research in professorial promotions, with an additional 24% stating that professorial promotions based on teaching achievement were not possible at their institution.",

However, these courses can be difficult to access for the large numbers of teaching dominant staff on part-time and/or fixed term contracts, those who do have time allocated for continuing professional development (CPD) in their positions, or are in institutions who do not offer this support. There is therefore a need for professional development at a national level; in the past this has been provided by the Higher Education Academy who made available a wealth of resources, primarily through the Centre for Bioscience. Withdrawal of government funding in recent years has unfortunately resulted in the loss of the Subject Centre in 2011 and the Biosciences discipline lead in 2014. The HEA does maintain however a role in providing professional recognition for teaching through the UK Professional Standards Framework ( Turner et al. , 2013 ), and also provides accreditation for courses and training schemes.",

It is here that the Teaching-Focussed academic can risk becoming an island, with restricted funding, losing those opportunities for renewed inspiration and sharing of good practice. This is especially true of those early in their career that have not yet established links across institutions. With the HEA no longer offering subject-specific support, an obvious alternative are the learned societies, who have always played an important role in providing networking opportunities for academics. Education meetings run by organisations such as SEB are hugely important in providing Teaching-Focussed academics to meet and exchange ideas; none of the authors of this piece knew each other before attending SEB meetings. Learned societies also have a valuable role to play in filling the gap in terms of external mechanisms of validation; for example, the Society of Biology has taken over the HEA funded HE Bioscience Teacher of the Year award.",

While having separate societies makes sense for research activities, the challenges facing educators in the different areas of bioscience are quite similar. For the early-career bioscience teacher it can be unclear which society is the natural \u2018home\u2019 for them, and belonging to all societies would be prohibitively expensive.

At the SEB meeting (December 2014), we discussed whether educational meetings should be integrated within society-wide meetings or whether meetings should be specialised on education, perhaps across several learned societies. The advantage for removing the segregation between \u201cresearch\u201d and \u201cteaching\u201d academics, may be to improve the status of teaching and spread good practice further than simply \u201cpreaching to the choir\u201d. The advantage of more specialist education meetings is that common themes often arise in learning and teaching across a wide variety of disciplines, as seen by the attendance of physicists at the SEB meeting.

There is wide variation in the support universities provide, with some institutions nurturing a high quality environment for teaching staff, while others lag behind. However, even with the best possible local institutional support, the fragmented nature of the Teaching-Focussed community means that national organisations are essential to bring otherwise isolated individuals together. As the HEA is unlikely to fund subject-specific initiatives again without a major increase in funding, it falls to the learned societies to provide cross-institutional support for Teaching-Focussed academics, particularly through providing bioscience education conferences. Presenting at education-focussed sessions enables sharing of good practice, external validation of teaching activities, and ultimately, as this article demonstrates, opportunity for new collaborations. As one of us noted, \u201c I never planned my route through academia or imagined myself as an educator; it is through my involvement in learned societies that I have met the key people that allowed me to see that there is no \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d concept of an academic \u201d.",

Unfortunately, during my post-doctoral post the opportunities to teach didn\u2019t arise and I started considering carefully what I enjoyed and realised I found communicating biology far more fulfilling than spending my time in a fairly solitary capacity focused on a narrow, detailed research area. Despite publishing a handful of papers I decided not to embark on another research position and applied and acquired an hourly- paid lecturing position at a Post-92 institution and a fixed-term, part-time Teaching Fellow contract at my current institution.",

For these reasons at the start of the following academic year I took on more teaching at my current institution rather than the Post-92 institution, despite it being a much longer commute. After 3 and half years juggling temporary and part-time positions, I was given an open-ended Teaching Fellow contract.",

During my Masters and PhD I trained wildlife conservation professionals in field and analytical skills, tutored fellow PhD students and post-docs, and demonstrated in undergraduate statistics labs. For my first post-doc I was tasked to develop a post-graduate diploma in conservation research skills. I rapidly realised that I didn\u2019t have sufficient understanding of curriculum design, how to structure engaging learning activities, and how to effectively assess student learning, let alone the process of getting a new course approved by my institution. I joined a CPD course in learning and teaching run by the University of Oxford\u2019s Learning Institute and was lucky to be mentored by an inspirational educator, Dr Chris Trevitt, who has since left Oxford. He supported me to submit a portfolio to the HEA to gain recognition as a Fellow. It was challenging to do this alongside creating my course and then teaching it almost single-handedly, but the exposure to pedagogical theory and the opportunity to discuss ideas and applications with my peers was invaluable.",

I came back to the UK and spent 2 years teaching for the University on an informal freelance basis, where the lack of job security was very stressful.

The University is currently debating whether there should be a formal career structure for those on Teaching-Focussed contracts, but at present career development opportunities are unclear. I love teaching in HE and I achieve some of the highest student feedback in my department, but the isolation is challenging.

This led to me working in eight universities in three countries in just one decade. After 6 years in Cambridge and Oxford, I started my first post-doctoral position in Canada, thinking only of research; an extension of my PhD when I had viewed teaching as an enjoyable side-activity that I only engaged in when I needed money or had time for a bit of \u201cCV building\u201d. At the end of this post-doc, unemployment looming, a colleague in my research area encouraged me to teach research skills at a research institute in Nigeria for 6 months. This proved a pivotal turning point in my career, and I realised then that teaching could have as much impact as research. The freedom my Nigerian students gave me to experiment with my own teaching style, has also proved invaluable in my lectureship, where I have had confidence to take risks in teaching and innovate.",

I decided to go against my research-led job contract, ignore advice of most senior staff, except the open-minded head of school at the time, and decided to love my job and ignore my h-index. I loved teaching, so that\u2019s what I mostly did. This risk paid off, since my institution has begun, like many UK universities to value teaching more, and my department has been supportive of my move to a more Teaching-Focussed contract, whilst keeping a job contract that is now permanent rather than fixed-term. I am not sure my career route would have been for everyone (the constant moving was stressful), but I would say that you can\u2019t simply copy the career routes of older staff - higher education is in constant flux, so the strength to calculate your own trajectory is important, although this is not without risk.\u2019",

        "abstract": "Twenty-seven percent of academics in UK Higher Education (HE) are in Teaching-Focussed positions, making major contributions to undergraduate programmes in an era of high student expectations when it comes to teaching quality. However, institutional support for Teaching-Focussed academics is often limited, both in terms of peer networking and opportunities for career development. As four early-career stage Teaching-Focussed academics working in a variety of institutions, we explore what motivated our choices to make teaching our primary academic activity, and the challenges that we have faced in doing so. In addition to highlighting the need for universities to fully recognise the achievements of teaching staff, we discuss the role that the various biosciences learned societies have in supporting Teaching-Focussed academics. We identify that there is a need for the learned societies to come together and pool their expertise in this area. The fragmented nature of the Teaching-Focussed academic community means that clear sources of national support are needed in order to best enable the next generation of bioscience educators to reach their full potential.",
