Based on their length at tagging, all individuals appeared to be either mature or close to maturity, but were recaptured between 7.7 and 12.8 years later. As neither species was reported to be particularly long-lived these results are interesting, and provide evidence that both species live longer than currently thought. Age was also estimated and compared in four of the samples by reading sectioned vertebrae. These data contribute to growing evidence that longevity of sharks is often underestimated when based on vertebral ageing methods, and that some aspects of elasmobranch demography that have been inferred from these studies (e.g. survival) may be biased. I\u2019m glad the authors have taken the time and effort to document these observations, as there are relatively few long-terms studies of this kind.",

Unfortunately, neither of these original growth studies presented the model variance, a detailed description of the data, or even any plots of the size at age data! Without this information, it is hard to get an idea of how variable size-at-age is for these species (and it is clearly quite variable), or the representativeness of the original sampling, etc. Personally, I think other information could be more useful, like photographs of the two oldest vertebrae sections for reference.",
