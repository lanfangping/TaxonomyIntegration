Policies can increase the benefit potential to society of basic biomedical research by offering various kinds of incentives to basic researchers. In this paper we argue that soft incentives or \u201cnudges\u201d are particularly promising. However, to be well designed, these incentives must take into account the motivations, goals and views of the basic scientists. In the paper we present the results of an investigation that involved more than 300 scientists at Harvard Medical School and affiliated institutes. The results of this study suggest that some soft incentives could be valuable tools to increase the transformative value of fundamental investigations without affecting the spirit of the basic research and scientists\u2019 work satisfaction. After discussing the findings, we discuss a few examples of nudges for basic researchers in the biomedical fields.",

Sadly, public expenditure for research has decreased since then and nowadays fundamental sciences are for the most part underfunded. Basic biomedical research currently receives less support than it received only a few years ago. For instance, in the United States, National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding has been nearly stationary since 2003 in the face of rapid expansion (as increased amount of research activity) of existing biomedical fields and the emergence of new ones <REF-1> , <REF-6> . One explanation of the low support for fundamental sciences is our cognitive bias in favor of immediate rewards.

Softer incentives, not based on restrictive policies, which are often called by behavioral economists \u201cnudges\u201d <REF-28> , seem particularly promising. If properly designed for basic research, nudges would slightly (and sometimes unperceivably) reorient some scientists in a certain direction without imposing rules or decreasing work satisfaction. However, these \u201cnudges\u201d can be designed well for basic research only if we have a good grasp of what motivates basic scientists, what their values are and the intellectual frameworks in which they operate so that soft incentives can be properly tailored. Studies on scientist\u2019s views and values often focus on research misconduct <REF-29> \u2013 <REF-31> or on particular issues of specific biomedical fields <REF-32> \u2013 <REF-36> .

To understand what scientists think about this restrictive (i.e. non voluntary) policy, Q13 asked respondents to express their level of agreement with the following statement: \u201cWritten proposals about basic biological/biomedical research generally contain a section discussing potential future health benefits. These sections increase the likelihood that a project benefits future public health\u201d. 12.3% of the respondents were in complete agreement with this statement, 35.0% were in partial agreement, 35.0% were in partial disagreement and 17.7% were in complete disagreement ( Figure 5 ). To shed light on how scientists would improve current funding criteria we asked (Q14) the following question: \u201cWhat percentage of public funding should be allocated to basic biological/biomedical research proposals in which discussing the potential of future health benefits to society is not required?\u201d The mean response was that 41.6% of public funding, on average, should be allocated to research in which a discussion of the potential health benefits is not required in written proposals ( Figure 6A ) (standard deviation was 25.72; 3.4% of the respondents to this question declared 0%; 6.6% of the respondents declared 100%). Q15 asked: \u201cWith regard to basic biological/biomedical research proposals in which discussing the potential of future health benefits to society is required, what average weight should be given to this potential in assigning scores for funding decisions?\u201d The average \u201cweight\u201d was 35.7% ( Figure 6B ) (standard deviation was 25.87; 6.7% of the respondents to this question declared 0%). Thus, the majority of respondents believe that discussing the potential future health benefits in basic research proposals is not an effective way to increase the likelihood that a project benefits future public health. Principal investigators were substantially more in disagreement than post-docs (63.4% and 41.2%, respectively) with regard to the effectiveness of this policy in increasing societal benefits ( Figure S5 ). Moreover, these scientists believe that a considerable proportion of public funding (41.6%) should be allocated to research proposals in which discussing the future health benefits to society is not required.",

While the benefits to society may be not realized in the near future, a substantial majority of respondents (74%) ( Figure 4A ) agreed/partially agreed on the idea that some degree of estimation of the potential contribution to human health is possible for every basic research proposal. Further, they indicated that, ideally, more than half of public funding should be allocated to proposals in which a discussion of the potential future health benefits to society is required ( Figure 6A ). Moreover, with regard to the definition of basic research, nearly all respondents (94%) ( Figure 1B ) indicated that thinking about the future practical benefits of their research is compatible with the status of \u201cbasic\u201d researchers, thus implying that basic research should not be conceptualized as (necessarily or solely) driven by curiosity.",

Creative nudges should entail little additional work for scientists and can be implemented without significantly increasing public spending and bureaucratic burden. We also believe that soft incentives would be a valuable departure from some current policies which seem ineffective. For example, while 92% of respondents indicated that they are in favor of an increase in public funding for basic biological/biomedical research ( Figure S4 ), a substantial majority of the principal investigators (63%) ( Figure S5 ) declared that the sections in written proposals aimed at discussing the potential future health benefits do not really increase the likelihood that a project will benefit future public health. Our respondents also claimed that more public funding (on average the 42% of the total public funding committed to basic biological/biomedical research) should be devoted to basic biological/biomedical research proposals in which discussing the potential of future health benefits is not required ( Figure 6A ).",

One example would be placing research laboratories inside or in close proximity to hospitals to expose basic scientists to the view of patients and practicing physicians; in this regard it would be useful to know if scientists already working in laboratories inside hospitals have different views, motivations and values than those working in comparable laboratories located far away from hospitals.",

This type of incentive would make use of the \u201cribbon-motivation\u201d but without undermining the \u201cpuzzle-motivation\u201d or research freedom generally <REF-14> , <REF-40> . This system could work by implementing a \u201cbibliography of basic papers\u201d for each newly approved drug. To apply this idea, a peer review group would identify the basic papers that have been influential for the development in the drug (or other biological applications) or, alternatively, review a list proposed by the drug owner <REF-41> . A list of fifty to one hundred basic research papers would be selected and appear in the public databases (like the Orange Book of FDA) and in the drug package. Scientists would receive satisfaction from seeing their work in the list of seminal papers crucial for the design of a new drug, by perceiving their active role in public health improvement and by posting the achievement on their curriculum vitae or personal website. This system would be a \u201cweak attractor\u201d because it would not distract scientists from basic research but it would represent a small, mostly unconscious, incentive to pursue research lines that can more easily lead to future drugs and should not create imbalances in the system by pushing basic scientists towards non-basic investigations. Therefore this system would not dramatically affect the whole \"ecosystem\" of the scientific research that indeed needs to be made of a balanced mix of the different types of research, from the \"purely\" basic to the \"purely\" applied ( Figure 8 ). This method would also present the advantage of increasing public awareness of the role of basic science, which we think is often underestimated by lay people as well as politicians.",

A portion of basic research should (continue to) be devoted to purely curiosity-driven purposes as knowledge per se has a value and increases the quality of life of people through fascination and \u2018soul nourishment\u2019. However, basic research should not be conceptualized as solely driven by curiosity. Indeed, in our survey, nearly all respondents (94%) ( Figure 1B ) indicated that thinking about the future practical benefits of their research is compatible with the status of \u201cbasic\u201d researchers. Therefore, similar to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\u2019s division of the continuum of basic research into pure basic research and oriented basic research ( http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=192 ), we believe basic research can usefully be divided into two broad categories: solely curiosity-driven research and research driven by a vision of how the knowledge generated might be useful for future applications. In this context, the term \u201cblue skies research\u201d, sometimes used to define the entire field of basic research <REF-42> might be used for those studies that are solely (or largely) curiosity-driven. This division of basic research would be similar to the previously proposed division between \u201cpure basic research\u201d (also represented as the \u201cBohr\u2019s quadrant\u201d as exemplified by the work of the atomic physicist Niels Bohr) and \u201cuse-inspired basic research\u201d (also represented as the \u201cPasteur\u2019s quadrant\u201d as exemplified by the work of the biologist Louis Pasteur) <REF-11> , <REF-43> . Even if curiosity does remain one of the main motivators for conducting and studying science, we believe that basic research should be conceptualized as research that focuses on basic mechanisms of natural phenomena rather than research that is intended to satisfy scientists curiosity (as it is frequently presented in the mass media). Such a mindset would hopefully result in more basic scientists (especially younger ones) pondering the purpose of their research and being inspired by basic research avenues that are \u201cuse-inspired\u201d.",

In fact, the great majority of scientists who took part in our survey pointed out that, despite the fact that it is usually necessary to undertake a very long pathway (the \u201ccountless sources\u201d mentioned by Abraham Flexner <REF-4> ) before being able to funnel basic knowledge toward more applicative studies, some degree of assessment of the transformative value of basic investigations is always possible. It follows that since the potential benefits for society are somewhat predictable, basic research can be evaluated prospectively; this does not lessen the \u201cbasic status\u201d neither of the research nor of the scientist. Such a revised mindset could \u201cnudge\u201d more basic scientists (and grant funders) to wonder about the future impact of their investigations. Of course, it will also be important to estimate in the best possible way and, case by case, the degree (i.e. possibility) of assessment of the transformative value, as an overestimation of our ability to assess the transformative value of research projects could have negative effects on both innovation potential and scientist satisfaction. Plausibly, future study and discussion will shed more light on these concepts and increase our ability to assess the social potential of fundamental investigations.",

The large majority of respondents were in favor of using soft incentives to increase the health benefit potential of basic biological/biomedical research. The use of \u201cnudges\u201d seems to be particularly promising with the basic scientists at the earlier stages of their career; compared to principal investigators post-docs are more likely to think that the major goal of basic biological and biomedical research is to provide health benefits to society, are even more driven by prestige and financial motivations and are even more in favor of the use of soft incentives. This suggests that in the near future even more scientists will be suitable for soft motivational incentives, even if we cannot exclude that current younger scientists will slightly change their perspectives and values when they reach more advanced stages in their career. Even so, most principal investigators are also in favor of using soft incentives (especially non-financial ones) and are dissatisfied (substantially more so than the post-docs ( Figure S5 )) with the current policies requiring the assessment of potential health benefit.",

Answers could be provided through multiple choices or, alternatively, textboxes for alphanumerical entries. Each question had the option to be skipped. The survey was sent to a sample of scientists involved in basic biological/biomedical studies (for the most part, cell and molecular biology studies). The scientists were also asked to confirm their level of involvement in basic fundamental research (see results section). The responses were collected during 9 consecutive weeks during 2012. Principal investigator (PI) scientists were contacted by email after consulting the websites of Harvard University and some affiliated institutes (Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center and Children\u2019s Hospital); the majority of principal investigators were asked to forward the survey to members of their own groups. Post-docs were contacted either by their PIs or by using university-associated mailing lists and networking. Also a few scientists with other types of position (e.g. PhD students, instructors, research assistants) took part in the survey, generally contacted by their PIs. In addition to the specific request to forward the survey to their own groups or to close intra-institutional colleagues, the contacted scientists were specifically asked not to forward the survey to the outside community. The survey was completely voluntary. The response rate is not known because we do not know how many scientists actually read the invitation email and how many principal investigators forwarded the invitation to their lab members. We used this approach because we wanted to maximize the sample size. By taking in consideration only the scientists that took part to the survey, the response rate was very high for all questions (on average, fewer than 2% of the respondents, with a range from 0% (Q2 and Q3) to 6.3% (Q15) skipped any of the 17 questions); this suggests that the survey did not contain difficult-to-understand or difficult-to-answer questions. Therefore the decision of participating (or not) in the survey was probably not based on the nature of the questions but rather on other factors (e.g. lack of time) that, conceivably, have only a marginal effect on the representativity of the sample. Moreover, the survey was completely anonymous. For these reasons, we believe that the sample of scientists that took part to this survey is fairly representative of the entire population of scientists working in the same setting (Harvard Medical School and affiliated institutes).",

        "abstract": "Basic research in the biomedical field generates both knowledge that has a value per se regardless of its possible practical outcome and knowledge that has the potential to produce more practical benefits. Policies can increase the benefit potential to society of basic biomedical research by offering various kinds of incentives to basic researchers. In this paper we argue that soft incentives or \u201cnudges\u201d are particularly promising. However, to be well designed, these incentives must take into account the motivations, goals and views of the basic scientists. In the paper we present the results of an investigation that involved more than 300 scientists at Harvard Medical School and affiliated institutes. The results of this study suggest that some soft incentives could be valuable tools to increase the transformative value of fundamental investigations without affecting the spirit of the basic research and scientists\u2019 work satisfaction. After discussing the findings, we discuss a few examples of nudges for basic researchers in the biomedical fields.",
