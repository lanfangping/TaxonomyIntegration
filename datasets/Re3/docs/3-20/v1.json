Policies can increase the benefit potential to society of basic biomedical research by offering various kinds of incentives to basic researchers. In this paper we argue that soft incentives or \u201cnudges\u201d are particularly promising. However, to be well designed, these incentives must take into account the motivations, goals and views of the basic scientists. In the paper we present the results of an investigation that involved more than 300 scientists at Harvard Medical School and affiliated institutes. The study shows that basic researchers\u2019 support for soft incentives is such that the transformative value of fundamental investigations can be increased without affecting the spirit of the basic research and scientists\u2019 work satisfaction.

Sadly, public expenditure for research has decreased since then and nowadays fundamental sciences are for the most part underfunded. Basic biomedical research currently receives less support than it received only a few years ago. For instance, in the United States, National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding has been nearly stationary since 2003 in the face of rapid expansion of research activity in existing biomedical fields and the emergence of new ones <REF-1> . One explanation of the low support for fundamental sciences is our cognitive bias in favor of immediate rewards. As our brains are structured in a way that leads us to unduly favor immediate rewards over future benefits <REF-5> , we tend to underestimate the importance of human activities and initiatives with benefits that lie in the future <REF-6> . Furthermore, basic researchers are said to owe a moral duty to extract maximum transformative value (the potential to translate into novel and fruitful applied research) whenever their research is publicly funded <REF-7> , <REF-8> .

New strategies to successfully maximize the transformative value of basic research without compromising the nature of fundamental inquiries are certainly needed. Softer incentives, which are called by behavioral economists \u201cnudges\u201d <REF-12> , seem particularly promising as they have been successfully used in public health but not yet in basic research.

However, these \u201cnudges\u201d can be designed well for basic research only if we have a good grasp of what motivates the basic scientists, what their values are and the intellectual frameworks in which they operate so that the proper soft incentives can be tailored around the particular characteristics of basic scientists.",

On average, fewer than 2% of the respondents, with a range from 0% (Q2 and Q3) to 6.3% (Q15) skipped any of the 17 questions. Answers could be provided through multiple choices or, alternatively, textboxes for alphanumerical entries (see Methods section for additional details). 304 scientists took the survey. The first four questions of the questionnaire (Q1\u2013Q4) gathered data on the sample characteristics. The first question (Q1) (all questions hereinafter will be referred to as Q#) aimed at identifying the respondent\u2019s academic position: 39.9% declared themselves to be principal investigators, 34.7% to be post-docs, 10.6% to be PhD students and 14.9% to belong to other categories (including \u201cresearch assistants\u201d and \u201cresearch technicians\u201d) ( Figure S1 ). Q2 focused on gender. The sample\u2019s gender distribution turned out to be 42.1% females and 57.9% males ( Figure S2 ). Q3 asked respondents to quantify the amount of their research time allocated to research that they consider to be \u201cbasic\u201d. On average, respondents reported spending 76.3% of their research time on basic research ( Figure S3 ), with only 3.6% of respondents stating that they were not involved (0%) in basic research. In order to test respondents\u2019 commitment to basic research in general, Q4 asked them if they agreed/disagreed with the following statement: \u201c Despite the current economic situation, public funding for basic biological/biomedical research should be increased \u201d. 92.4% of the respondents agreed with the previous sentence while only 7.6% disagreed ( Figure S4 ). Overall, these results show that our purposive sample was well balanced with regard to academic position and gender and that the surveyed scientists were significantly involved in basic investigations and (for the great majority) supportive of increased public funding for basic biological/biomedical research.",

Interestingly, we noticed that principal investigators were significantly more in disagreement than post-docs (63.4% and 41.2%, respectively) with regard to the effectiveness of this policy in increasing societal benefits ( Figure S5 ).

While the benefits to society may be not realized in the near future, a substantial majority of respondents (74%) ( Figure 3A ) agreed/partially agreed on the idea that some degree of estimation of the potential contribution to human health is possible for every basic research proposal. Further, they indicated that, ideally, more than half of public funding should be allocated to proposals in which a discussion of the potential future health benefits to society is required. Moreover, with regard to the definition of basic research, nearly all respondents (94%) ( Figure 1B ) indicated that thinking about the future practical benefits of their research is compatible with the status of \u201cbasic\u201d researchers, thus implying that basic research should not be conceptualized as (necessarily or solely) driven by curiosity.",

Building on these results, we conclude that nonfinancial soft incentives (nudges), in particular, are perceived as valuable tools to maximize the transformative value of basic research as they would not entail much work for scientists and can be implemented without significantly increasing public spending and bureaucratic burden. We also believe that soft incentives would be a valuable departure from current policies, which according to the scientists surveyed in our study, are ineffective. Indeed, despite 92% of respondents indicating that they are in favor of an increase in public funding for basic biological/biomedical research ( Figure S4 ), a significant majority of the principal investigators (63%) ( Figure S5 ) declared that the sections in written proposals aimed at discussing the potential future health benefits do not really increase the likelihood that a project will benefit future public health. Scientists also claimed that more public funding (on average the 42% of the total public funding committed to basic biological/biomedical research) should be devoted to basic biological/biomedical research proposals in which discussing the potential of future health benefits is not required ( Figure 4B ).",

Another one would be organizing more (non-mandatory) educational meetings in which scientists explain their work to the general public or to associations of patients (giving credit to the participating scientists). A similar proposal would be organizing periodical seminars inside research institutions to discuss the role of scientific research and scientists in society.

This system could work by implementing a \u201cbibliography of basic papers\u201d for each newly approved drug. To apply this idea, a peer review group would identify the basic papers that have been influential for the development of the drug (or other biological applications) or, alternatively, review a list proposed by the drug owner <REF-14> . A list of fifty to one hundred basic research papers would be selected and appear in the public databases (such as the Orange Book of the FDA) and in the drug package. This system would be a \u201cweak attractor\u201d because it would not distract scientists from basic research but it would represent a small, mostly unconscious, incentive to pursue research lines that can more easily lead to future drugs. Therefore this system would not dramatically affect the whole \u201cecosystem\u201d of the scientific research that indeed needs to be made of a balanced mix of the different types of research, from the \u201cpurely\u201d basic to the \u201cpurely\u201d applied ( Figure 6 ).

A portion of basic research should (continue to) be devoted to purely curiosity-driven purposes as knowledge per se has a value and increases the quality of life of people through fascination and \u2018soul nourishment\u2019. However, basic research should not be conceptualized as solely driven by curiosity. Indeed, in our survey, nearly all respondents (94%) ( Figure 1B ) indicated that thinking about the future practical benefits of their research is compatible with the status of \u201cbasic\u201d researchers. Therefore, similar to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\u2019s division of the continuum of basic research into pure basic research and oriented basic research ( http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=192 ), we believe basic research can usefully be divided into two broad categories: solely curiosity-driven research and research driven by a vision of how the knowledge generated might be useful for future applications. In this context, the term \u201cblue skies research\u201d, sometimes used to define the entire field of basic research <REF-15> might be used for those studies that are solely (or largely) curiosity-driven. Even if curiosity does remain one of the main motivators for conducting and studying science, we believe that basic research should be conceptualized as research that focuses on basic mechanisms of natural phenomena rather than research that is intended to satisfy scientists curiosity (as it is frequently presented in the mass media). Along these lines, we must also revisit the idea that since the future benefits of basic research cannot be accurately predicted, all basic research is equally valuable, i.e. every imaginable basic investigation would have the same exact potential of practical outcome. In fact, the great majority of scientists who took part in our survey pointed out that, despite the fact that it is usually necessary to undertake a very long pathway (the \u201ccountless sources\u201d mentioned by Abraham Flexner <REF-3> ) before being able to funnel basic knowledge toward more applicative studies, some degree of assessment of the transformative value of basic investigations is always possible. It follows that since the potential benefits for society are roughly predictable, basic research can be evaluated prospectively; this does not lessen the \u201cbasic status\u201d of either the research or the scientist. Such a revised mindset could \u201cnudge\u201d more basic scientists (and grant funders) to wonder about the future impact of their investigations.",

Principal investigator (PI) scientists were contacted by email after consulting the websites of Harvard University and some affiliated institutes (Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center and Children\u2019s Hospital); the majority of principal investigators were asked to forward the survey to members of their own groups.

        "abstract": "Basic research in the biomedical field generates both knowledge that has a value per se regardless of its possible practical outcome and that has the potential to produce more practical benefits. Policies can increase the benefit potential to society of basic biomedical research by offering various kinds of incentives to basic researchers. In this paper we argue that soft incentives or \u201cnudges\u201d are particularly promising. However, to be well designed, these incentives must take into account the motivations, goals and views of the basic scientists. In the paper we present the results of an investigation that involved more than 300 scientists at Harvard Medical School and affiliated institutes. The study shows that basic researchers\u2019 support for soft incentives is such that the transformative value of fundamental investigations can be increased without affecting the spirit of the basic research and scientists\u2019 work satisfaction. After discussing the findings, we suggest a few examples of nudges and discuss one in more detail.",
