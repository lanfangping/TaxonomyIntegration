A fact explaining the location of stations for the dogfish was deleted. The introduction section was updated by fixing grammatical errors in citations in two sentences. The authors also modified a fact here from Ruilfson et al. and mentioned that their data was not recorded. The methods section was vastly simplified by deleting quite a few factual sentences which explained the authors methodical approach and executed tasks. The authors also modified two sentences by changing the facts about their shark capturing data. Furthermore, two sentences were merged, and clarity was enhanced. In the results section a few sentences explaining the data found from  authors experiments were deleted. The recorded depth value of the station was modified in one sentence here. In the discussion section a few sentences were corrected which had some minor punctuation errors in the citations. Furthermore, the authors deleted three sentences with their claims about the spiny dogfish.  Also, a fact about sharks by Heithaus et al. and one fact regarding spiny dogfish by the authors were deleted as well.",
