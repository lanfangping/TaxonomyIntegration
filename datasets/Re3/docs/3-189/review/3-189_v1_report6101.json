I believe though that the authors need to pare back the content in the methods section to that relevant to the main focus of the paper and not overstate the findings as they relate to habitat use within the estuary in the results and discussion sections. The information obtained in this manuscript has importance in documenting previously unknown temperatures but the authors need to understand that this is the importance and not try to interpret minimal data for habitat use.",

Remove sentences referring to capture site in relation to inlets and seagrass areas. There is not enough information to do analysis in regards to habitat use.\n- Discussion Remove the sentence in the fourth paragraph beginning with \"Spiny dogfish feed primarily on...\" as this is way too speculative based on the catch of a few harvest fish in one net that also caught spiny dogfish.
