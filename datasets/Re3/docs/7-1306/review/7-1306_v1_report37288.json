Although I appreciate the same information is being presented in both plots (hence this being a minor comment), it would be helpful to use violin plots instead of the current plots. First, violin plots are de facto (and the GenePattern plot does not add information) and secondly, outliers are given more presence in violin plots (data is plotted directly on the plot and the tail of the plot to higher values is not hidden by an axis).
