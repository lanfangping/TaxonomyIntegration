Despite substantial efforts to carry out reliable live evaluation of systems in recent competitions, annotations have been abandoned and reported as too unreliable to yield sensible results. This is a serious problem since automatic metrics are not known to provide a good indication of what may or may not be a high-quality conversation. Answering the distress call of competitions that have emphasized the urgent need for better evaluation techniques in dialogue, we present the successful development of human evaluation that is highly reliable while still remaining feasible and low cost. Self-replication experiments reveal almost perfectly repeatable results with a correlation of r = 0.969. Furthermore, due to the lack of appropriate methods of statistical significance testing, the likelihood of potential improvements to systems occurring due to chance is rarely taken into account in dialogue evaluation, and the evaluation we propose facilitates application of standard tests. Since we have developed a highly reliable evaluation method, new insights into system performance can be revealed. We therefore include a comparison of state-of-the-art models (i) with and without personas, to measure the contribution of personas to conversation quality, as well as (ii) prescribed versus freely chosen topics. Interestingly with respect to personas, results indicate that personas do not positively contribute to conversation quality as expected.",

In addition, evaluation faces further challenges with respect to the ability to fully take into account dialogue history. 1 In this paper, we present a new method of opendomain dialogue evaluation based on human assessment of live conversations with models that avoids the need for pre-created reference dialogues and ensures full familiarity with dialogue history, ticking two important boxes in terms of validity. Although live human evaluation of models has the advantage of being highly valid, reliability unfortunately cannot be assumed and developing methods of evaluation for language tasks that achieve high rater consistency has been challenging, often resulting in low levels of agreement between annotators (Finch and Choi, 2020;Callison-Burch et al., 2011, 2012Bojar et al., 2013Bojar et al., , 2014Mehri and Eskenazi, 2020b). Despite challenges in this respect, our proposed method provides highly reliable evaluation, achieving a correlation of r = 0.969 in selfreplication experiments. Additionally, the evaluation can be carried out cheaply and on a large scale through strict quality controlled crowd-sourcing, as well as including score standardization for fairer ranking of competing models. We make the data and code publicly available to aid future research. 2",

For example, ConvAI2 (Dinan et al., 2019) ranked models firstly using automatic metrics before top models according to metric scores were assessed by crowd-sourced workers on Mechanical Turk, while similarly in the sixth Dialog System Technology Challenge (DSTC6) systems were filtered according to metric scores prior to human evaluation.",

However until such methods can be accessed and independently verified through replication studies, they will unfortunately have little impact . The first Amazon Alexa Socialbot Grand Challenge required human assessors to score how coherent and engaging conversations were on a 1-5 rating scale by two distinct groups: volunteer Amazon employees (experts), and general Alexa users (crowds) (Ram et al., 2018), are reported to achieve a correlation of overall scores for the two types of human assessors at 0.93. The absolute average rating across all chatbots was reported to be 20% lower for experts compared to general users. In an additional effort to evaluate models, conversational user experience, coherence, engagement, domain coverage, topical diversity, and conversational depth were assessed (1-5 scale), with combined scores reported to correlate with those of general users at r = 0.66. In addition to methods and data not being publicly available, correlations are difficult to interpret since no detail is provided about the number of judgments on which the correlation is calculated for example.",

How-ever, inappropriate statistics are often applied. For example, Pang et al. (2020) propose a holistic metric to automatically evaluate four distinct aspects of dialogue, and a human evaluation experiment is deployed on Mechanical Turk using a 1-5 rating scale. The mean correlation between human assessors is reported as r = 0.61. However, mean correlations are unfortunately difficult to interpret, since correlation coefficients are not additive , averages calculated in the usual way cannot be assumed to reflect central tendency, and unfortunately, the distribution of correlations is not reported (Alexander, 1990). Mehri and Eskenazi (2020b) propose USR (Un-Supervised and Reference-free), an unsupervised model that predicts the quality of dialog for a range of criteria using various rating scales: understandable (0-1 rating scale), natural (1-3), maintains context (1-3), interesting (1-3), uses knowledge (0-1); overall quality (1-5). Despite human evaluation being carried out by experts inter-annotator agreement levels varied depending on criteria being measured, ranging from as low as 0.298. Additionally, although correlations between human assessments are reported as significant at p < 0.01, despite such statistics often being reported for correlations, they are unfortunately not very meaningful in terms of their impact on correlation interpretation and can be somewhat misleading. Contrary to common expectations, even small effect sizes (low r) can produce very low p-values (strong significance) in such tests. Aiming to achieve a significant correlation is an extremely low bar to reach in terms of consistency, since a low p-value in this case simply rejects the null hypothesis that the correlation is zero.",

The score distribution of each human assessor is standardized according to overall mean and standard deviation of all ratings provided by that assessor, thus removing any adverse effects of those employing overly harsh (or indeed lenient) scoring strategies. Secondly, the 0-100 rating scale allows standard significance tests to score distributions of models to help determine which models significantly outperform others. Thirdly, and possibly most importantly, a continuous rating scale facilitates highly accurate quality control of crowd-sourced workers so that the evaluation can scale while still maintaining validity at a low cost. Each human assessor is firstly asked to carry out a live conversation with a randomly selected model, comprised of a minimum of 10 conversational inputs, before rating the quality of the conversation that just took place under a number of criteria shown in Figure 1.

Technically speaking, the most meaningful reliability measures for continuous ratings scales test consistency of aggregate (system-level) results because although a high level of random error is expected in individual continuous rating scale scores, when aggregates are calculated for large samples of ratings, positive and negative error that is truly random effectively cancels itself out, and does not negatively impact consistency. In other words, the rating scale we employ does not rely on consistency on the level of individual ratings. We nonetheless examine individual rater consistency, since it is the standard approach, but keep in mind that results in this part of our meta-evaluation are not crucial when testing reliability for an evaluation carried out via a continuous rating scale where consistency in overall system-level results are more important.",

In contrast, for pairs of workers who pass quality control, the peak of agreement is between an r of 0.6 and 0.7, showing high agreement in general between such annotator pairs. Some of the observed disagreement is likely to be the result of legitimate differences between scores of two workers who chose distinct topics to discuss with the same model however, an unavoidable source of inconsistency when testing models with respect to the open domain. Interestingly, in 5% of dialogues, worker pairs assigned the same hit happened to both freely choose an identical topic to discuss with the same model.

Results in Table 3 reveal that (perhaps un-expectedly) in general models are either rated more favorably by human assessors when they carry out dialogues without a persona or a tie occurs between models with and without a persona. In contrast to the initial experiment in which workers were permitted to choose the topic of conversation, we further investigate the performance of models in a slightly easier setting where the topic under discussion is known to the model, by selecting a statement from its persona, which we refer to as an ice-breaker topic statement. An ice-breaker topic statement is then provided to human assessors at the beginning of each conversation, and the assessor is instructed to talk about this topic with the model. We therefore provide the topic of conversation to workers in the form of an ice-breaker topic statement, corresponding to a randomly selected persona statement belonging to the agent. Again, we run this experiment on MTurk, this time contrasting results for our initial data collection run where workers freely chose a topic with one in which workers were instructed to talk about the ice-breaker statement with models. Numbers of workers who participated in the Icebreaker run are provided in Table 1, while a breakdown of results for each model and overall average scores are shown in Table 4 as well as the correlation between scores for systems when a topic is freely chosen. Interestingly, in terms of absolute differences in raw scores, the best performing model achieves higher fluency, consistency and is deemed less repetitive when evaluated in icebreaker conversations compared those with freely chosen topics. 9 Relatively speaking, in terms of system rankings, no meaningful difference in relative performance is observed when models are tested in a scenario where the worker chooses a topic and when one is prescribed with an icebreaker statement, as can be seen from the strong correlation between scores for models in Free run 1 and Ice-breaker evaluation (Table 4). 10",
