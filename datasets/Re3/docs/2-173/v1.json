            "content": "Inhaled glucocorticoids are the first-line treatment for patients with persistent asthma. However, approximately thirty percent of patients exhibit glucocorticoid insensitivity, which may involve excess metabolic clearance of the glucocorticoids by CYP3A enzymes in the lung. CYP3A4, 3A5, and 3A7 enzymes metabolize glucocorticoids, which in turn induce CYP3A genes. However, the mechanism of CYP3A5 mRNA regulation by glucocorticoids in lung cells has not been determined. In hepatocytes, glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which induces the expression of the constitutive androstane receptor or pregnane X receptor; both of which bind to the retinoid X receptor alpha, leading to the induction of CYP3A4, 3A5, and 3A7. There is also evidence to suggest a direct induction of CYP3A5 by GR activation in liver cells. In this study, these pathways were evaluated as the mechanism for CYP3A5 mRNA induction by glucocorticoids in freshly isolated primary tracheal epithelial, adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial (A549), immortalized bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B), primary normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial (NHBE), primary small airway epithelial (SAEC), and primary lobar epithelial lung cells. In A549 cells, beclomethasone 17-monopropionate ([M1]) induced CYP3A5 mRNA through the glucocorticoid receptor. CYP3A5 mRNA induction by five different glucocorticoids was attenuated by inhibiting the glucocorticoid receptor using ketoconazole, and for beclomethasone dipropionate, using siRNA-mediated knock-down of the glucocorticoid receptor. The constitutive androstane receptor was not expressed in lung cells. SAEC cells, a primary lung cell line, expressed CYP3A5, but CYP3A5 mRNA was not induced by glucocorticoid treatment despite evaluating a multitude of cell culture conditions. None of the other lung cells expressed CYP3A4, 3A5 or 3A7 mRNA. These studies demonstrate that CYP3A5 mRNA is induced by glucocorticoids in A549 cells via the glucocorticoid receptor, but that additional undefined regulatory processes exist in primary lung cells.",

In hepatocytes, CYP3A enzyme induction is mediated by the pregnane X receptor (PXR) <REF-19> , <REF-20> ( Figure 2A ). However, PXR is not expressed in the lung <REF-21> . Glucocorticoids can also influence CYP3A induction via the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) in the liver <REF-22> , <REF-23> . Briefly, glucocorticoids bind GR in the cytosol, which forms a homodimer and translocates into the nucleus, leading to increased transcription of CAR. CAR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor alpha (RXR\u03b1), which binds to the RXR-response element and induces the expression of CYP3A enzymes ( Figure 2A ) <REF-22> . Previous work by Hukannen et al. demonstrated that CAR was not expressed in A549 (adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial) cells and suggested that glucocorticoid binding to GR may directly regulate CYP3A gene expression in A549 cells ( Figure 2B ), based on inhibition using RU-486 <REF-15> , <REF-24> .

For the remainder of the studies, [M1], the active metabolite, was used as a marker for esterase activity and [M5] was used as a marker for CYP3A5 activity. Only CYP3A5*1 mRNA was detected in A549 cells. CYP3A4 and CYP3A7 mRNA were not detected in A549 cells, as previously documented <REF-11> , <REF-16> . BDP treatment significantly induced the expression of CYP3A5 mRNA (~2-fold) compared to the DMSO control ( Figure 3B ). Inhibiting the production of [M1] using esterase inhibitors also blocked the induction of CYP3A5 mRNA ( Figure 2A and Figure 2B ); esterase inhibitor (EI) treatment alone had no effect on CYP3A5 expression. 1-ABT, a mechanism-based inactivator of P450 enzymes, also inhibited esterase activity (i.e. [M1] formation) ( Figure 3A ), and as a result, prevented the induction of CYP3A5 mRNA ( Figure 3B ).",

It was hypothesized that the high concentration of hydrocortisone (500 \u00b5M) in the SAEC growth media prevented the induction of CYP3A5 mRNA by substantially lower concentrations of the glucocorticoids used in the treatments. Elimination of hydrocortisone from the media decreased the basal expression of CYP3A5 mRNA ( Figure 6 ). However, no change in mRNA abundance was observed over a 24 h treatment period with BDP. Furthermore, neither increasing the treatment concentration of BDP to 50 \u00b5M, nor treatment with [M1] at 150 \u00b5M led to an increase in CYP3A5 mRNA in SAEC cells. It was subsequently hypothesized that phthalates or other substances in the FBS might alter GR function and CYP3A5 mRNA induction by glucocorticoids <REF-27> . However, neither heat inactivation nor charcoal-stripping of the FBS in media with or without hydrocortisone led to CYP3A5 mRNA induction.

Subsequent studies using a competitive antagonist of GR (ketoconazole) and siRNA selective for GR mRNA, demonstrated that inhibition of GR function prevented the induction of CYP3A5 mRNA by BDP and other glucocorticoids in A549 cells ( Figure 4A\u2013E and Figure 5B ). It was also demonstrated that CAR mRNA was not expressed by lung cells, consistent with previous data <REF-15> , and therefore could not be involved in the regulation of CYP3A5 expression by glucocorticoids as occurs in hepatocytes. It was concluded that CYP3A5 expression was directly regulated by GR ( Figure 2B ). Schuetz et al. <REF-24> previously described two \u201chalf sites\u201d of GR (TGTTCT) separated by 160 bp in the promoter region of CYP3A5 in HepG2 cells and in human and rat hepatocytes. It was demonstrated that dexamethasone induced the expression of CYP3A5 by the GR homodimer binding to these two joined \u201chalf-sites\u201d which could be blocked by RU-486, a GR antagonist.

CYP3A5 mRNA expression was quantified in primary lung cells, which presumably more closely model epithelial cells of the human respiratory tract and lung. NHBE, lobar, and cells recovered from tracheal washes of mechanically ventilated children were evaluated for CYP3A enzyme expression and induction by glucocorticoids. Results in Table 2 show that CYP3A mRNA was not expressed in cells of the conducting airways in response to glucocorticoid treatment, indicating that these epithelial cells likely do not play a role in CYP3A-dependent metabolism of glucocorticoids in the lung. In contrast, select donor samples of SAEC cells, representing cells of the distal bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli, did express CYP3A5 ( Table 2 ). However, there was no change in CYP3A5 mRNA when these cells were treated with glucocorticoids. A thorough examination of potential confounding issues associated with cell culture revealed a high concentration of hydrocortisone (500 \u00b5M) in the growth media. Because cells were treated with only 10 \u00b5M BDP, it would stand to reason that no change in CYP3A5 mRNA would occur because CYP3A5 expression would already be maximized as a result of hydrocortisone activating the GR pathway.",

When A549 cells were subsequently cultured in media without hydrocortisone for 48 h, providing sufficient time for a \u201cwash out\u201d of the hydrocortisone, the basal expression of CYP3A5 mRNA was reduced, and ~2-fold induction of CYP3A5 mRNA occurred with the 10 \u00b5M BDP, 24 h treatment. Therefore, hydrocortisone was omitted from the SAEC growth media. Subsequent experiments in SAEC cells showed no change in CYP3A5 mRNA in response to glucocorticoid treatment ( Figure 6 ), albeit removal of hydrocortisone from the media caused a slight decrease in the basal level of CYP3A5 mRNA expression, suggesting that GR plays a role in the regulation of CYP3A5. It is feasible that because cells had been exposed to such high concentrations of hydrocortisone during their isolation and expansion, that 10 \u00b5M of BDP was not sufficient to induce CYP3A5 mRNA, even after culturing the cells in the absence of hydrocortisone for multiple division cycles. Therefore, the concentration of BDP was increased to 50 \u00b5M and an additional treatment group using 150 \u00b5M [M1] was added. Again no increases in CYP3A5 mRNA was observed. Heat-inactivated and charcoal-stripped FBS were also utilized to remove potential interfering compounds from FBS, and still no change was observed.",

        "title": "Regulation of CYP3A genes by glucocorticoids in human lung cells",
        "abstract": "Inhaled glucocorticoids are the first-line treatment for patients with persistent asthma. However, approximately thirty percent of patients exhibit glucocorticoid insensitivity, which may involve excess metabolic clearance of the glucocorticoids by CYP3A enzymes in the lung. CYP3A4, 3A5, and 3A7 enzymes metabolize glucocorticoids, which in turn induce CYP3A genes. However, the mechanism of CYP3A5 mRNA regulation by glucocorticoids in lung cells has not been determined. In hepatocytes, glucocorticoids bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which induces the expression of the constitutive androstane receptor or pregnane X receptor; both of which bind to the retinoid X receptor alpha, leading to the induction of CYP3A4, 3A5, and 3A7. There is also evidence to suggest a direct induction of CYP3A5 by GR activation in liver cells. In this study, these pathways were evaluated as the mechanism for CYP3A5 mRNA induction by glucocorticoids in freshly isolated primary tracheal epithelial, adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial (A549), immortalized bronchial epithelial (BEAS-2B), primary normal human bronchial/tracheal epithelial (NHBE), primary small airway epithelial (SAEC), and primary lobar epithelial lung cells. In A549 cells, beclomethasone 17-monopropionate ([M1]) induced CYP3A5 mRNA through the glucocorticoid receptor. CYP3A5 mRNA induction by five different glucocorticoids was attenuated by inhibiting the glucocorticoid receptor using ketoconazole, and for beclomethasone dipropionate, using siRNA-mediated knock-down of the glucocorticoid receptor. The constitutive androstane receptor was not expressed in lung cells. SAEC cells, a primary lung cell line, expressed CYP3A5, but CYP3A5 mRNA was not induced by glucocorticoid treatment despite evaluating a multitude of cell culture conditions. None of the other lung cells expressed CYP3A4, 3A5 or 3A7 mRNA. These studies demonstrate that CYP3A5 mRNA is induced by glucocorticoids in A549 cells via the glucocorticoid receptor, but that additional undefined regulatory processes exist in primary lung cells.",
