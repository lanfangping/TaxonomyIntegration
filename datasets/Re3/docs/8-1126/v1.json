            "content": "A classical ayurvedic polyherbal formulation namely Triphala was assessed for its anti-pathogenic potential against five different pathogenic bacteria. Virulence of four of them towards the model host Caenorhabditis elegans was attenuated (by 18-45%) owing to pre-treatment with Triphala (\u226420 \u00b5g/ml). Triphala could also exert significant therapeutic effect on worms already infected with Chromobacterium violaceum , Serratia marcescens or Staphylococcus aureus . Prophylactic use of Triphala allowed worms to score 14-41% better survival in face of subsequent pathogen challenge. Repeated exposure to this formulation induced resistance in S. marcescens , but not in P. aeruginosa . It also exerted a post-extract effect (PEE) on three of the test pathogens. Triphala was able to modulate production of quorum sensing (QS)-regulated pigments in three of the multidrug-resistant gram-negative test bacteria. Haemolytic activity of S. aureus was heavily inhibited under the influence of this formulation. P. aeruginosa's lysozyme-susceptibility was found to increase by ~25-43% upon Triphala -pretreatment. These results validate therapeutic potential of one of the most widely used polyherbal ayurvedic formulations called Triphala .",

            "content": "Antibiotic-resistant bacterial infections are among the most serious public-health threats. Since the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is shrinking the utility spectrum of conventional bactericidal antibiotics, there is an urgent need for discovery and development of novel anti-virulence formulations. Traditional Medicine (TM) systems like Ayurveda offer several sophisticated formulations for a variety of disease conditions. One such classical ayurvedic formulation with a long history of safe use is Triphala . Triphala is a polyherbal formulation containing three myrobalans fruits i.e. Phyllanthus emblica, Terminalia chebula, and Terminalia bellerica ( Patwardhan et al ., 2015 ). Triphala is prescribed as a general health promoter, for management of metabolic disorders, dental and skin problems, and for wound management. It has been reported to be active against bacterial pathogens of urinary tract ( Bag et al ., 2013 ), and as an anticaries agent for control of gum infections ( Bhattacharjee et al ., 2015 ; Prakash & Shelke, 2014 ). Though many popular formulations like Triphala have been used historically in TM and as a household remedy, their validation through modern scientific methods is necessary for their wider acceptance in modern medicine ( Kothari, 2018 ). This study aimed to investigate the anti-pathogenic efficacy of Triphala against five different pathogenic bacteria.",

Broth dilution assay ( Joshi et al ., 2016 ) to investigate effect of Triphala on bacterial growth and quorum sensing (QS)-regulated pigment production: C. violaceum , and S. marcescens were inoculated in nutrient broth (HiMedia MV002-500G) supplemented with TF. Media used for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were Staphylococcus broth (HiMedia M578-500G) and Pseudomonas broth [10 g/l potassium sulfate (SRL 44277), 1.4 g/l magnesium chloride (Merck 1.9366.30521), 16 g/l peptone (HiMedia RM001-500G)] respectively. S. pyogenes was grown in BHI (brain heart infusion; HiMedia MV210-500G) broth. Following incubation, cell density was measured at 750 nm (Biorad 680). Pigment from these culture broths were extracted as previously described by us in Joshi et al. (2016) . Cell pellets of C. violaceum , S. marcescens , and S. aureus were dissolved in DMSO [(Merck 1.07046.2521), acidified methanol [4 ml HCl (HiMedia AS003-500ML) into 96 ml of methanol], and methanol (Merck 1.94516.2521) respectively. This allowed their pigments to be extracted in the solvent applied. In case of P. aeruginosa , pigment extraction was achieved by mixing chloroform (Merck 1.67024.0521) with culture broth (2:1 ratio). Quantification of each pigment was done at the wavelength nearest to its \u03bb max, available in the microplate reader (Biorad 680) used by us.\n- b. Effect of Triphala on biofilm formation and its possible potential to eradicate pre-formed biofilm was assessed through crystal violet assay ( Patel et al ., 2013 ); and its effect on biofilm viability was assessed through MTT assay ( Trafny et al ., 2013 ). For the crystal violet assay, the biofilm-containing tubes (after discarding the inside liquid) were washed with PBS in order to remove all nonadherent bacteria and air-dried for 15 min. Then, each of the washed tubes was stained with 1.5 mL of aqueous crystal violet solution (0.4%; SRL 54862-9) for 30 min. Afterwards, each tube was washed twice with 2 ml of sterile distilled water and immediately destained with 1500 \u03bcL of ethanol (95%). After 45 min of destaining, 1 mL of destaining solution was transferred into separate tubes and read at 570 nm (Biorad 680). For the MTT assay, the biofilm-containing tubes (after discarding the inside liquid) were washed with PBS in order to remove all nonadherent bacteria and air-dried for 15 min. Then, 900 \u00b5L of minimal media was added into each tube, followed by addition of 100 \u03bcL of 0.3% MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide; HiMedia MB186-100MG). After 2 h incubation at 37\u00b0C, resulting purple formazan derivatives were dissolved in DMSO and measured at 570 nm (Biorad 680).\n- c. Effect of Triphala on haemolytic potential of the test pathogens ( Neun et al ., 2015 ): Small volume of human blood required for this assay was obtained from the authors, who each gave their written informed consent. The use of this blood was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee of the Institute of Science, Nirma University (approval no: EC/NU/18/IS/4). Blood collection was executed by one of the authors (AA) on three different times in heparinized vials. OD 750 of the overnight grown (in presence or absence of TF) culture was standardized to 1.00. Cell-free supernatant was prepared by centrifugation at 15,300 g for 10 min. 10 \u03bcl of human blood was incubated with this cell-free supernatant for 2 h at 37\u00b0C, followed by centrifugation at 800 g for 15 min. OD of the supernatant was read at 490 nm, to quantify the amount of hemoglobin released. 1% Triton X-100 (CDH, New Delhi; CDH030632) was used as a positive control. Phosphate buffer saline was used as a negative control.\n- d. Effect of Triphala on lysozyme-susceptibility of test pathogens: Bacterial cells were first inoculated in a TF-containing media for 24 h, and then the cell pellet was separated by centrifugation [15,000 rpm (21130 g) for 15 min] to be resuspended into phosphate buffer saline (PBS; pH 7.4), so as to attain OD 750 =1 (Biorad 680). 200 \u00b5l of this bacterial suspension was mixed with lysozyme (750 \u00b5g/ml; Sigma Aldrich L6876-1G) prepared in PBS, and then incubated for 24 h at appropriate temp for each organism. At the end of incubation OD 750 was measured.",

To investigate whether previous feeding with TF can make the worm population tolerate subsequent challenge with pathogenic bacteria (not treated with TF) better; worms were first maintained in a TF-containing M9 buffer for 96 h, and then challenged with different bacterial pathogens. Such TF-fed worms scored 14.50\u201341.50% better survival in face of pathogen challenge [ Figure 5 ; underlying data ( Patel et al ., 2019c )]. However, TF did not confer any prophylactic benefit on the worm population against mix-culture challenge of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus . Since prophylactic activity of any formulation can be said to stem mainly from its effect on the host, we also compared whether TF imparts any extension of longevity on the worm. Worms fed with TF (10-20 \u00b5g/ml) registered marginally better survival up to 11 days ( Figure 6 ).",

Since one of the major challenges with even the most potent antimicrobial agents/formulations is development of resistance against them by the pathogen populations, we tested whether repeated exposure of the test pathogens to TF can induce any resistance in them. For this, we subcultured two of the gram-negative test pathogens ( P. aeruginosa and S. marcescens ) in TF (50 \u00b5g/ml)-containing broth for 10 subsequent times, and then the 'TF-habituated' cultures thus obtained were tested for their virulence towards the nematode host. Repeated TF-exposure was found to induce resistance in S. marcescens [ Figure 7A ; underlying data ( Patel et al ., 2019c )]. Though TF-habituated P. aeruginosa could kill more worms than its counterpart receiving single TF-exposure, it still could not kill as many worms as TF-unexposed P. aeruginosa [ Figure 7B ; underlying data ( Patel et al ., 2019c )]. These results indicate that it may be difficult for the pathogenic bacteria to develop complete resistance against polyherbal formulations like Triphala , but not impossible. Though our previous results on other polyherbal formulations ( Joshi et al. , 2019 ; Patel et al ., 2019a ) and multicomponent crude plant extracts ( Joshi, 2019 ) have indicated that the probability of pathogens developing resistance against multi-component anti-virulence preparations is low, such a probability can certainly not be ruled out ( Kalia et al ., 2014 ; Singh, 2014 )",

            "content": "Since TF showed significant in vivo anti-pathogenic potential in the C. elegans model, we performed various in vitro experiments to gain insight into its interaction with the target pathogens. TF was able to modulate production of quorum sensing (QS)-regulated pigments in all the three gram-negative bacteria [ Figure 8 ; underlying data ( Patel et al ., 2019c )]. It did so with S. marcescens without affecting its growth, which is characteristic of an ideal anti-virulence agent i.e. attenuation of virulence without exerting any selection pressure on the susceptible pathogen. However, TF did exert a growth-inhibitory effect on P. aeruginosa , wherein its IC 50 was observed to be near 50 \u00b5g/ml. The quorum modulatory effect of TF on pigment production in P. aeruginosa was observed not to be amenable to be described by a linear dose-response curve. It seems to fall within the realm of hormesis ( Calabrese, 2004 ). For example, production of both pigments was not affected maximally at the highest test concentration. Pyocyanin production was inhibited more at 0.5 \u00b5g/ml than at 20 \u00b5g/ml. Effect of TF on pyoverdine production followed a linear threshold model within concentration range of 0.5\u201350 \u00b5g/ml, but it took an inverted-U shape over 20-100 \u00b5g/ml. Though the exact mechanism responsible for a non-linear dose-response relationship is not known, it may be the varying magnitude of bacterial adaptive response at different concentrations of the test agent, which generates such non-linear response curves ( Lushchak, 2014 ).",

Though TF could not curb haemolytic activity of any of the gram-negative bacteria, this activity of S. aureus was heavily inhibited under the influence of TF [ Figure 9 ; underlying data ( Patel et al ., 2019c )]. While P. aeruginosa biofilm was not affected by TF, TF was able to reduce biofilm formation by S. marcescens , and S. aureus . When TF was applied on pre-formed bacterial biofilms, it seemed to enhance synthesis of the biofilm matrix material (quantified thorough crystal violet assay), and also the metabolic activity (measured in terms of organism's ability to reduce MTT) of the bacterial biofilm [ Figure 10 ; underlying data ( Patel et al ., 2019c )]. It may be speculated that TF-treatment induces stress in the bacterial population residing in biofilm form, and this causes the bacteria to mount stress-response. Slow metabolism is a general characteristic of bacterial biofilms ( Singh et al ., 2017 ), but TF seems to have forced the biofilms of two of our test bacteria to enhance the rate of their metabolic activity, as well as synthesis/secretion of biofilm matrix components (e.g. polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA). Enhanced production of exopolysaccharide and e-DNA is believed to occur in stressed bacterial populations ( Chang et al ., 2007 ; Zatorska et al ., 2018 ). Sub-inhibitory concentrations of beta-lactam antibiotics have been reported to induce extracellular DNA release and biofilm formation in some S. aureus strains ( Kaplan et al ., 2012 ).",

Since lysozyme is an important component of the innate defense machinery of human immune system against invading microbes ( Herbert et al ., 2007 ), we also studied whether TF can have any effect on susceptibility of the test pathogens to lysozyme. TF-treated cells of S. marcescens and S. aureus were found to suffer marginal (albeit statistically significant; p\u22640.05) increase in their susceptibility to lysis by lysozyme. P. aeruginosa's lysozyme-susceptibility was found to increase heavily (by ~25-43%) upon TF-pretreatment [ Figure 11 ; underlying data ( Patel et al ., 2019c )].",

Thus an ideal anti-pathogenic formulation should exert anti-pathogenic effects without inhibiting indigenous members of human microbiome. We tested TF's effect on three such bacteria ( Enterococcus faecium , Bifidobacterium bifidum , and Lactobacillus plantarum ) which are part of human microbiome, and also used as probiotic strains. Though TF did not exert any prebiotic potential by promoting growth of the probiotic bacteria, it also had no negative effect on them [Extended data: Figure S1 ( Patel et al ., 2019c )].",

It was also found to be efficacious as a post-infection therapy as well as a prophylactic measure against bacterial infection. Triphala can be said to possess a broad-spectrum of anti-pathogenic activity, which seems to partly arise from its ability to interfere with bacterial quorum-sensing. Its prophylactic efficacy indicates that it is not only exerting inhibitory effect on the susceptible bacteria, but also beneficial effect on the host worm, and thus can be described as a combination of immunomodulatory and anti-pathogenic activities in one formulation. Exerting such combined efficacy without displaying any negative effect on beneficial members of human microbiome are key attributes for 21 st century antimicrobials ( Laxminarayan et al ., 2013 ). Further investigation for elucidating the molecular mechanisms associated with the biological effects of Triphala are warranted, with special emphasis on its role in combating AMR. Such traditional medicine polyherbal formulations need not necessarily be thought of as replacement of conventional antibiotic treatments, but more realistically as adjunctive therapies boosting our efforts to tackle AMR effectively.",

Media used for S. aureus and P. aeruginosa were Staphylococcus broth (HiMedia M578-500G) and Pseudomonas broth [10 g/l potassium sulfate (SRL 44277), 1.4 g/l magnesium chloride (Merck 1.9366.30521), 16 g/l peptone (HiMedia RM001-500G)] respectively. S. pyogenes was grown in BHI (brain heart infusion; HiMedia MV210-500G) broth. Following incubation, cell density was measured at 750 nm (Biorad 680). Pigment from these culture broths were extracted as previously described by us in Joshi et al. (2016) . Cell pellets of C. violaceum , S. marcescens , and S. aureus were dissolved in DMSO [(Merck 1.07046.2521), acidified methanol [4 ml HCl (HiMedia AS003-500ML) into 96 ml of methanol], and methanol (Merck 1.94516.2521) respectively. This allowed their pigments to be extracted in the solvent applied. In case of P. aeruginosa , pigment extraction was achieved by mixing chloroform (Merck 1.67024.0521) with culture broth (2:1 ratio). Quantification of each pigment was done at the wavelength nearest to its \u03bb max, available in the microplate reader (Biorad 680) used by us.",

For the crystal violet assay, the biofilm-containing tubes (after discarding the inside liquid) were washed with PBS in order to remove all nonadherent bacteria and air-dried for 15 min. Then, each of the washed tubes was stained with 1.5 mL of aqueous crystal violet solution (0.4%; SRL 54862-9) for 30 min. Afterwards, each tube was washed twice with 2 ml of sterile distilled water and immediately destained with 1500 \u03bcL of ethanol (95%).

        "abstract": "A classical ayurvedic polyherbal formulation namely Triphala was assessed for its anti-pathogenic potential against five different pathogenic bacteria. Virulence of four of them towards the model host Caenorhabditis elegans was attenuated (by 18-45%) owing to pre-treatment with Triphala (\u226420 \u00b5g/ml). Triphala could also exert significant therapeutic effect on worms already infected with Chromobacterium violaceum , Serratia marcescens or Staphylococcus aureus . Prophylactic use of Triphala allowed worms to score 14-41% better survival in face of subsequent pathogen challenge. Repeated exposure to this formulation induced resistance in S. marcescens , but not in P. aeruginosa . It also exerted a post-extract effect (PEE) on three of the test pathogens. Triphala was able to modulate production of quorum sensing (QS)-regulated pigments in three of the multidrug-resistant gram-negative test bacteria. Haemolytic activity of S. aureus was heavily inhibited under the influence of this formulation. P. aeruginosa's lysozyme-susceptibility was found to increase by ~25-43% upon Triphala -pretreatment. These results validate therapeutic potential of one of the most widely used polyherbal ayurvedic formulations called Triphala .",
