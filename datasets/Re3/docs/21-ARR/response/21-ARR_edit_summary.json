A claim about Metadistil\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ability of parameter adjusting was modified.  In the related work section, a citation from Xu et al., & Xu & McAuley was added, and the citation year of Hinton et al. was modified again.  Also, two sentences were modified to fix grammatical mistakes. In one sentence here, the conjunction was modified to improve clarity. In the knowledge distillation section, the abbreviation form of mean squared error was added to improve clarity. One grammar error in a sentence was fixed in the learning to tech section. One fact about the quiz set parameters of students and teachers was added by the authors and one claim regarding the reasoning of using this quiz set strategy was added. Lastly two sentences were merged and simplified to improve clarity. In the experimental setup section 4 sentences were added explaining some facts about what authors reported from different experiments and what metric was used in them. One fact was added in the limitations section which compared the results of the authors approach with Sun et al.\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance of PKD. The discussion section was greatly changed starting with the addition of a fact about the Metadistill approach. One fact from Hooker et al. about the compression issue was added. Right after that one sentence claiming that this issue was not significant in authors experiments was added. In the next paragraph, two more sentences explaining some facts about Metadistil were added. After that, some facts from the papers table 4 were explained in a few sentences about their teacher experiment data for Metadistil. In the next paragraph, authors concluded why the model with the highest accuracy was not the best teacher with 5 added sentences explaining their data from figure 5. After that two claims from the authors were added claiming the possibilities of the reason for the performance improvement by Metadistil. One author\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fact about their conduction of analysis for MRPC dataset was added. Then one fact was added from Xu et al. about the prediction loyalty. After that two more facts were added about the authors finding from their Metadistil experiment. One sentence claiming that the origin of value improvement was not by the students better mimicking the teacher was added. One last fact was added which explained how the authors conducted their experiment for the second assumption. Finally, a claim by the author was deleted which expressed their interest in future research on this domain from the knowledge learnt from these experiments.",
