This constructive process is revealed through a number of classic size illusions such as the Delboeuf Illusion, the Ebbinghaus Illusion and others illustrating size constancy. Here we present a novel variant of the Delbouef and Ebbinghaus size illusions that we have named the Binding Ring Illusion. The illusion is such that the perceived size of a circular array of elements is underestimated when superimposed by a circular contour \u2013 a binding ring \u2013 and overestimated when the binding ring slightly exceeds the overall size of the array. Here we characterize the stimulus conditions that lead to the illusion, and the perceptual principles that underlie it. Our findings indicate that the perceived size of an array is susceptible to the assimilation of an explicitly defined superimposed contour. Our results also indicate that the assimilation process takes place at a relatively high level in the visual processing stream, after different spatial frequencies have been integrated and global shape has been constructed. We hypothesize that the Binding Ring Illusion arises due to the fact that the size of an array of elements is not explicitly defined and therefore can be influenced (through a process of assimilation) by the presence of a superimposed object that does have an explicit size.",

Due to the fact that we sense the 3D visual world through an analysis of 2D retinal images, the process of size perception is intrinsically ambiguous. As a result, the perception of an object\u2019s size arises from the integration of multiple sources of visual information including the size of its retinal image, its perceived distance <REF-1> , and its size relative to other objects in the visual scene <REF-2> , <REF-3> . These constructive processes are revealed through a number of classic size illusions such as the Ebbinghaus Illusion <REF-4> ( Figure 1A ) and the Delboeuf Illusion <REF-5> , <REF-6> ( Figure 1B ). In each of these illusions, the perceived size of an explicitly defined object (the inner circle) is influenced by the context in which it is presented. Here we address the question of how we perceive the size of an implicitly defined object\u2013an array of elements\u2013by introducing a novel variant of the Ebbinghaus illusion that we have named the Binding Ring Illusion. We describe the illusion and investigate the underlying mechanisms that lead to misperceived size.",

On a given trial, participants were presented with a small central fixation point (0.35\u00ba) for 500ms, followed by the additional simultaneous presentation of two circular arrays (a reference and a test) for 500ms at which point the stimuli were removed from the screen and replaced by a random noise mask displayed for 500ms to discourage afterimages. Participants indicated by pressing one of two buttons (two-alternative forced choice; AFC), which of the two stimuli had appeared larger. Each array consisted of 12 small equally spaced circles with radii of 0.05\u00ba visual angle. On every trial, the reference array had a fixed radius of 3\u00ba visual angle (from the center of the array to the center of any circular element). Using the method of constant stimuli <REF-10> , we investigated the perceived size of each of two test arrays compared to the reference array. The test array either had a binding ring superimposed or did not (the lack of a binding ring served as a control condition). In non-control conditions the binding ring had a radius selected to match the radius of the test circular array that was measured from the center of the array to the center of one of the smaller component circles. Because the control array did not have a superimposed binding ring it was identical to the reference array in all ways except its trial-by-trial size. As such, it was used to determine A) how accurately observers were able to perform the task (discriminate the sizes of the arrays) and B) to serve as a point of comparison for determining the size of the illusory effect. On each trial, the radius of the test array was selected from the following list: 2.5\u00ba, 2.6\u00ba, 2.8\u00ba, 2.9\u00ba, 3.0\u00ba, 3.1\u00ba, 3.3\u00ba, 3.4\u00ba and 3.5\u00ba.",

The clear and steep-sloped sigmoidal shaped psychometric curve derived from the control condition in which neither the reference nor control array have a binding ring confirm that participants were able to perform the task and accurately report their perceptions. Specifically, participants were at chance performance when the two arrays were indeed the same size. The rightward shift of the other psychometric curve, derived from the test (binding ring) condition, demonstrates that the size of the array was underestimated when the binding ring was present.

Because the size of an array is not explicitly defined, it remains unclear whether the illusion arises due to assimilation or contrast with the binding ring. In order to determine if the illusion is mediated by assimilation or contrast we investigated the effect of changing the size of the binding ring (bottom of Figure 5 ). If assimilation is responsible for the effect, we would predict that the magnitude of the illusion should increase as the binding ring gets smaller . Alternatively, if the illusion arises due to contrast, the magnitude of the illusion should increase as the binding ring gets larger .",

The individual trials within the staircases again consisted of a reference and test array simultaneously presented for 500ms. As in the previous experiment, the reference array had a fixed radius of 3\u00ba; however, unlike the previous experiment, the reference contained a binding ring and the test array did not. This was done so as to be able to compare the magnitude of the illusion for a fixed size array across binding-ring sizes. Separate staircases were run for five distinct reference conditions defined by the size of the binding ring with radii chosen from the following list: 2\u00ba, 2.67\u00ba, 3\u00ba, 3.33\u00ba and 4\u00ba (see Figure 5 ). Because the radius of each circular element was 0.5\u00ba, the binding ring did not physically overlap with the circular array in two of the five conditions and was either entirely inside (2\u00ba) or outside (4\u00ba) the array. Four staircases were run for each trial type\u2013two in which the initial test or control array was larger than the reference array (descending) and two in which it was initially smaller (ascending). The starting radius for the test or control array was randomly selected to be 0.5\u00ba to 1\u00ba larger or smaller than the radius of the reference array. On each trial, participants completed a 2AFC task indicating which stimulus had appeared larger. According to standard staircase procedures, the size of the test array was adjusted by a step size ranging randomly on each iteration from 2 to 5 pixels (0.07\u00ba to 0.18\u00ba) in the direction opposite of the participant\u2019s response. The staircase finished when four reversals were recorded. In total, each participant completed 20 staircases presented in pseudorandom order.",

As can be seen in Figure 5 , the magnitude of the illusion increases as the size of the binding ring is reduced for the three superimposed conditions. However, once the binding ring becomes too small, such that it no longer overlaps the array, the magnitude of the illusion is greatly decreased. That said, even in this innermost binding ring condition, the perceived size of the array is underestimated. It is noteworthy that this particular stimulus condition is quite similar to that typically used in the Ebbinghaus Illusion (see right side of Figure 1A ). Here we demonstrate that there are in fact two illusory effects revealed in the Ebbinghaus Illusion, one operating on the inner circle (making it appear larger) and one operating on the outer array (making it appear smaller). Taken together, these observed effects are consistent with the assimilation hypothesis and inconsistent with the contrast hypothesis. Furthermore, these results appear to indicate that the outer edge of the circular array is serving as a boundary for the assimilation. When the radius of the binding ring exceeds this boundary, the assimilation bias is to increase the perceived size of the array. Similarly, if the radius of the binding ring is within this boundary, the assimilation bias is to decrease the perceived size of the array.",

This analysis revealed a main effect of the binding ring on perceived size ( F (1, 11) = 27.05, p < 0.01), a main effect of spatial frequency on perceived size ( F (1, 11) = 12.30, p < 0.01) and a significant interaction between the binding ring and spatial frequency ( F (1, 11) = 5.57, p < 0.05). As can be seen in Figure 6B , for both low- and high-pass stimuli, the array containing the binding ring was perceived to be smaller than when no binding ring is present. As reflected in the significant interaction, this effect is greater when the stimuli are low- as compared to high-pass filtered. Although the illusion was observed in both the LSF and HSF configurations, the size of the effect observed for the LSF condition (~0.3\u00ba) is substantially larger than that observed in the previous experiments that range from 0.16\u00ba to 0.18\u00ba. In contrast, when the stimuli were high-pass filtered, the resultant ~0.2\u00ba reduction in perceived size is comparable to that observed in the previous experiments.",

The Binding Ring Illusion is a variant of the Delboeuf and Ebbinghaus Illusions and demonstrates that the perceived size of an array is subject to effects of assimilation. Specifically, the perceived size of a circular array of elements is underestimated when a \u2018binding ring\u2019 is superimposed on the array. The purpose of the above experiments was to demonstrate that the illusion can be quantified, to investigate possible explanations for its occurrence and to begin to characterize the stimulus factors that lead to misperceived size.",

Using both methods of constant stimuli and adaptive staircases we were able to measure significant differences in the perceived size of an array as a function of the presence and size of a binding ring. Secondly, the size of the binding ring significantly influences the magnitude of the illusion (experiment 2). Specifically, in order to produce the greatest effect, the binding ring has to superimpose the array and furthermore, as the size of the superimposed ring decreases, the magnitude of the illusion increases. These findings are consistent with existing assimilation theories of similar size illusions such as the Delboeuf and Ebbinghaus illusions <REF-7> , <REF-8> , <REF-13> , <REF-15> . In addition, the perceived size of the array was slightly increased only when the binding ring was large enough to completely encompass the array. This suggests that the outer radius of the array serves as the reference point for the assimilation process. It has been argued that assimilation is largely influenced by the perceived unification of the components as a single object <REF-15> , <REF-24> . This is consistent with our results such that the strongest assimilation effects occurred when the circle was superimposed on the array and could be easily perceived as a unified figure. In these conditions we observe a significantly larger magnitude of size illusion than when the binding ring was not superimposed on the array.",

Indeed, the smallest binding ring condition in experiment 2 is an identical configuration to that commonly used to demonstrate the Ebbinghaus illusion.",

However, in both cases the magnitude of the illusion is comparable if not greater than that observed with full spectrum stimuli. As such, we can conclude that: either processes within distinct spatial frequency channels can independently lead to the illusion, or the illusion is mediated by mechanisms at a later stage of processing that follows the integration of high- and low-spatial frequencies. In the latter case, one may conjecture that the initial LSF bias is attenuated once spatial frequency information has been integrated in object recognition areas such as those located in the inferotemporal cortex (IT) <REF-25> . One hypothesis for why the illusion is greater in the LSF condition is that due to blur, the individual array elements in the LSF condition are perceptually larger than the HSF and full-spectrum conditions. Because the elements appear larger, the perceived distance between the outer radius of the array and the binding ring is increased. The results of experiment 2 suggest that this may lead to an increased assimilation effect. Alternatively, the blurring of the image increases the thickness of the binding ring and it could be the case that this increases its effect on the perceived size of the array. Further research will be necessary to fully determine why the blurred stimulus increased the magnitude of the illusion.",

            "content": "Thirdly, the illusion does not manifest when only the local configural features of the binding ring are present. This was true even when the binding ring only connects the array elements (experiment 4a). This result is intriguing because past work has demonstrated that elements that are perceptually grouped into a common object will be perceived to be closer together than those that are not. Specifically, if a series of dots are arranged to form a dotted contour, the distance between any two adjacent dots will be perceived as being shorter than the distance between any one of them and another equally-distanced dot that does not lie along the contour <REF-26> . One possible extension of this observation is that an object formed out of the grouping of individual elements may appear smaller on the basis of the elements appearing closer together. Based on this assumption we thought it possible that the partial binding ring of experiment 4a may serve as an additional cue that the individual elements belong to a common object and therefore lead to it appearing smaller. The configuration of experiment 4a explicitly links the elements of the array; however, this does not lead to the illusory reduction in perceived size. This may be explained by the observed effects of the Oppel-Kundt Illusion <REF-27> , <REF-28> that demonstrates that the distance between two points is overestimated when it is filled with a number of tick marks compared to two equally spaced points of an undivided extent; however, as the density of these divisions increases, the effect diminishes <REF-28> . Therefore, connecting the interior elements should lead to a more veridical perception as observed here. As such, it is unlikely that the Binding Ring Illusion arises due to a misperception of the perceived distance between array elements.",

For example, the circles could be grouped into pairs symmetrical about the vertical axis, or perceived as ellipses arranged in an elliptical array that is receding in depth. That we perceive such a stimulus as a circle reflects the constructive processes that are embodied in the functional and structural architecture of the visual system. Importantly, the circle that we perceive does not explicitly exist in the retinal image and must therefore be constructed. As such, the size of the circle that we perceive must be itself constructed as well. The Binding Ring Illusion demonstrates that this constructive process includes the assimilation of other co-occurring stimuli, particularly those that spatially overlap the array.",

        "title": "The Binding Ring Illusion: assimilation affects the perceived size of a circular array",
        "abstract": "Our perception of an object\u2019s size arises from the integration of multiple sources of visual information including retinal size, perceived distance and its size relative to other objects in the visual field. This constructive process is revealed through a number of classic size illusions such as the Delboeuf Illusion, the Ebbinghaus Illusion and others illustrating size constancy. Here we present a novel variant of the Delbouef and Ebbinghaus size illusions that we have named the Binding Ring Illusion. The illusion is such that the perceived size of a circular array of elements is underestimated when superimposed by a circular contour \u2013 a binding ring \u2013 and overestimated when the binding ring slightly exceeds the overall size of the array. Here we characterize the stimulus conditions that lead to the illusion, and the perceptual principles that underlie it. Our findings indicate that the perceived size of an array is susceptible to the assimilation of an explicitly defined superimposed contour. Our results also indicate that the assimilation process takes place at a relatively high level in the visual processing stream, after different spatial frequencies have been integrated and global shape has been constructed. We hypothesize that the Binding Ring Illusion arises due to the fact that the size of an array of elements is not explicitly defined and therefore can be influenced (through a process of assimilation) by the presence of a superimposed object that does have an explicit size.",
