1-12,1-12_v1_report345_10@1,The close proximity of the PPM and PVM seem to make vesicle trafficking not the most suitable way for this.,Yes
1-12,1-12_v1_report345_11@0,"- Although an opinion article, alternatives to cytoplasmic acetylation could perhaps be discussed.",Yes
1-12,1-12_v1_report345_4@1,"Although the proposed model fits a lot of the data on protein export, there are also some discrepancies that become obvious when delving into the details.",Yes
1-12,1-12_v1_report345_5@0,"- The explanation why the mDHFR fusion constructs (REF 32) do not challenge the hypothesis (page 5, third and fourth paragraph) is difficult to understand.",Yes
1-12,1-12_v1_report345_5@1,Is it assumed that the mDHFR domain is in the ER lumen while the PEXEL binds to the outside of the ER and that this binding would be able to rescue the unfolded domain but not the folded version out of the ER?,Yes
1-12,1-12_v1_report345_5@2,In this case it is not entirely clear how this fits into the model for translocation of proteins into the ER.,Yes
1-12,1-12_v1_report345_5@3,A graphical explanation of the topology of this situation with the mDHFR fusion protein and how it can ensue would be helpful.,Yes
1-12,1-12_v1_report345_5@5,"As an aside on this topic: while it is true that functional evidence for the PVM translocon is lacking, it may be worth noting that there is some earlier evidence for ATP-dependent translocation of an exported protein across the PVM (Ansorge et al., 2006; Biochem J).",Yes
1-12,1-12_v1_report345_6@9,These findings seem to be at odds with the proposed model.,Yes
1-12,1-12_v1_report345_7@0,"- The data on the exact localisation of plasmepsin V, while not exactly excluding the possibility suggested in this review (page 2), could as well indicate a localisation within the ER.",Yes
1-12,1-12_v1_report345_7@3,The conclusion here that this data ‘demonstrates that it is not a signal sequence’ may therefore not be correct.,Yes
1-12,1-12_v1_report345_7@4,It is also not clear why PMV would possess an N-terminal hydrophobic region at all if it is targeted by its C-terminal hydrophobic region (P. falciparum contains components for the insertion of tailanchored proteins which do not require a signal peptide).,Yes
1-12,1-12_v1_report345_8@0,"- The explanation for PEXEL negative protein (PNEP) export is a bit weak (page 5, first paragraph).",Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report457_3@11,I find this hard to interpret as it could suggest that,Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report457_3@14,It would be helpful if the authors could discuss this result in more detail.,Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report457_3@2,"I do, however, wonder about the independence of the results for doubling time (measured as optical density) and cell size.",Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report457_3@4,"The authors state that “Analyses of the distribution of several flow cytometry profiles showed that a difference in cell shape is unlikely to explain this result (see data associated to this article)” Since this is an absolutely central result of the finding, I would find it very helpful if the authors actually presented and discussed this evidence.",Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report457_3@5,"In fact, it was not clear to me which data were in support of this.",Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report457_3@6,"Otherwise, I do not think that the results should be used to primarily suggest a phage-induced response of increased growth rate, with a cost of decreased cell size.",Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report457_5@0,"First, I wonder whether the authors could clarify their thoughts on the mechanism underlying the change to smaller cell size and/or increased doubling time of bacteria encountering inactivated phages.",Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report457_6@0,"Second, I think the finding that bacteria treated with inactivated phages show changes in growth rate and/or cell size but do not differ in terms of their resistance to live phages is quite interesting! I would be keen to know what the infection rates of the control and treated populations were, as this would help with interpretation of the result.",Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report457_6@3,"The authors mention that smaller surface area would mean a lower encounter rate with phages, but this doesn’t seem to be the case when the cells are exposed to live phages.",Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report457_7@0,"As a very minor point, I wonder whether the authors meant to say that bacteria were separated from unbound, rather than bound, phages in their methods section, as it is unclear how centrifugation would separate bacteria from bound phages.",Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report458_1@0,"1. ls there a subpopulation of the UV inactivated phage that are destroyed in the process of creating them, such that addition to bacterial cultures might constitute addition of DNA that can be taken up through transformation ?",Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report458_1@1,"If so, is it possible that this transformed DNA is being used as a nutrient by the bacteria? This might explain the slight increase in growth rate of phage-exposed bacteria in the experiments.",Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report458_1@3,The authors should take this possibility into account.,Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report458_2@0,2. It is unclear what constitutes the controls performed in this study.,Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report458_2@1,"One choice of control would be to obtain the UV-inactivated phage, and then remove these particles via centrifugation.",Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report458_2@3,"However, it is unclear whether this was the approach used, and therefore I am worried that the chosen control is insufficient for drawing proper conclusions in the work.",Yes
1-21,1-21_v1_report458_3@0,"Overall, the work seems very preliminary, and the data presented are not strongly supportive of the conclusions drawn.",Yes
1-23,1-23_v1_report314_3@0,I think that the final section ‘final remarks’ should be replaced with the title ‘conclusions’.,Yes
10-ARR,10-ARR_v1_review1_3@1,-The chosen evaluation metrics are neither appropriate nor insightful for the task.,Yes
10-ARR,10-ARR_v1_review1_3@3,"It is still unsatisfying that a well thought out pipeline has not been convincingly evaluated.
",Yes
10-ARR,10-ARR_v1_review1_3@4,"-The human evaluation helps somewhat but is very limited because it lacks comparisons with other methods.
",Yes
10-ARR,10-ARR_v1_review1_3@5,-Use of existing resources -- lack of scientific novelty,Yes
10-ARR,10-ARR_v1_review1_4@1,I would strongly advise the authors to provide a discussion/comparison with respect to: https://aclanthology.org/2020.sigdial-1.2.pdf Consider improving the work with a more sophisticated human evaluation on the actual dialogue task.,Yes
10-ARR,10-ARR_v1_review1_5@1,"It is not clear to me if the following paper is not cited and compared with to preserve anonymity (i.e., some authors are the same). 
",Yes
10-ARR,10-ARR_v1_review2_3@1,- The core contribution of the work is unclear: this work is a collection of work the authors done around reflective listening: a dataset and the pipeline to collect it; two methods for incorporating knowledge; a series of vastly different experiments.,Yes
10-ARR,10-ARR_v1_review2_3@2,"The authors are advised to limit the scope to one of the contributions and elaborate on just that.
-Each individual contribution is limited in significance:     - The dataset itself is not carefully curated and the highlight instead is the automation of dataset creation process from Google search, which is also a complex collection of several trivial steps itself and is prone to propagated errors. 
    ",Yes
10-ARR,10-ARR_v1_review2_3@3,"- The two methods proposed are mostly based on pre-existing libraries along with a series of engineering techniques (e.g., turning triplets into sentences using templates, masking out part of the input, combining K-BERT with BART, etc.). No novel architecture tailored to the studied task is being proposed. 
    ",Yes
10-ARR,10-ARR_v1_review2_3@4,"- The evaluation metrics are not well-motivated thus it is not entirely clear how well do they reflect the usefulness of the proposed techniques. The human evaluation was performed by just 2 annotations with their professional background unspecified. 
    ",Yes
10-ARR,10-ARR_v1_review2_3@5,"- Again, additional experiments in Section 4.5 is an overly detailed piece of information and is not super relevant to rest of the writing.",Yes
10-ARR,10-ARR_v1_review3_3@1,"- Lack of illustrative examples regarding the model outputs.
",Yes
10-ARR,10-ARR_v1_review3_3@2,"-Some details regarding the knowledge collection process have been omitted (see ""Questions"" below).",Yes

110-ARR,110-ARR_v1_review1_3@1,The performance for some tasks and some models increased significantly but this is not true in all cases.,Yes
110-ARR,110-ARR_v1_review1_3@3,But it does not explain all results (like Bert small better than large even after intermediate training).,Yes
110-ARR,110-ARR_v1_review1_3@4,The authors did also not comment on the difference of behaviour of BERT and Roberta models.,Yes
110-ARR,110-ARR_v1_review1_4@1,One table with all the results - before and after intermediate training would help readers to observe differences.,Yes
114-ARR,114-ARR_v1_review1_3@3,"
- Case visualization contains only two examples of each instance and consists of mere conjectures about the reason behind their model’s performance and errors.",Yes
14-ARR,14-ARR_v1_review1_3@1,"1. Authors could have investigated Vrank predictions, towards understanding where the model makes mistakes.",Yes
14-ARR,14-ARR_v1_review1_3@6,"This seems to be a weakness of the proposed approach since by definition, it is trying to imitate human judgment, but without access to the same information that annotators had to decide.",Yes
14-ARR,14-ARR_v1_review1_3@7," In the Appendix, ""Model Design"" section, authors state that tried vision and language models but do not provide details.",Yes
14-ARR,14-ARR_v1_review1_3@9,"Given the insights gathered by the authors, I would expect a critical discussion regarding the inclusion of Vrank in VIST evaluation protocols.",Yes
14-ARR,14-ARR_v1_review1_4@1,"In overall, the paper is well written, but there are some minor typos so I would suggest proofreading the manuscript.",Yes
14-ARR,14-ARR_v1_review1_4@2,"Some of the typos/grammar issues found: -Line 130-131: check grammar -Line 248: ""... and is ..."" -Line 400-401: check grammar -Line 426: ""autometric"" -Line 556-557: check grammar",Yes
14-ARR,14-ARR_v1_review2_3@1,"1. The related work section, especially the part related to ""VIST-Human Evaluation"", should report more details about the difference between their approach and previous state of the art",Yes
14-ARR,14-ARR_v1_review2_3@2,2. It would be beneficial if the authors could release both their data as well as pretrained model in order to make sure that other researchers can reuse their evaluation and potentially build upon their work,Yes
14-ARR,14-ARR_v1_review2_4@1,1. Typo Line 516,Yes
14-ARR,14-ARR_v1_review3_3@4,"
One small technical concern: For Table 4, The BLEU-4 score is suspiciously low, especially in comparison to SacreBLEU, which also computes BLEU-4.",Yes
14-ARR,14-ARR_v1_review3_3@5,"My suspicion is that BLEU-4 is often zero for some stories, which leads to many ties of 0 vs 0. I think that ties should be broken randomly, or that the authors should mention this is the cause (if indeed my suspicions are correct).",Yes
152-ARR,152-ARR_v1_review1_3@1,"1. The improvements are marginal, inparticular the ConLL.    ",Yes
152-ARR,152-ARR_v1_review1_3@3,"Thus, the paper should compare with this line of work.",Yes

152-ARR,152-ARR_v1_review1_4@3,2. Significance test might be needed.      ,Yes
156-ARR,156-ARR_v1_review1_1@4,"However, in the model evaluation part, the paper does not show how their model can generate diverse responses given the same context.",Yes
156-ARR,156-ARR_v1_review1_3@1,"1. This paper lacks a discussion on its novelty, e.g., why continuous latent variables are better than discrete latent variables for solving the one-to-many mapping problem.",Yes
156-ARR,156-ARR_v1_review1_3@3,It is not very clear to me why we should choose those techniques to train a continuous variational encoder-decoder.,Yes
156-ARR,156-ARR_v1_review1_3@4,"Maybe some ablation studies on the training objective and model architecture can help explain it. 
",Yes
156-ARR,156-ARR_v1_review1_3@5,2. The model evaluation does not show the model's superiority in solving the one-to-many mapping problem in open-domain dialogue response generation.,Yes
156-ARR,156-ARR_v1_review1_3@6,Distinct-1/2 are corpus-level metrics and are not showing the diversity of generated responses given the same context.,Yes

156-ARR,156-ARR_v1_review1_4@1,1. It is unclear to me what's the input to the prior network.,Yes
157-ARR,157-ARR_v1_review1_3@1,I am still a little concerned about the Figure 2.,Yes
157-ARR,157-ARR_v1_review1_3@2,This still requires a high-res display and zoom-in.,Yes
157-ARR,157-ARR_v1_review1_3@3,I suggest the authors use supplementary pages or materials to show a clearer and detailed version of the table.,Yes

169-ARR,169-ARR_v1_review1_1@11,"Although the author claims that their work is the first for QA, there is significant overlap between this work and Campos et al. (2020), which also uses binary user feedback to improve a Conversational QA model. But it is not cited in the paper.",Yes
169-ARR,169-ARR_v1_review1_1@3,"Notably, the author does not really deploy the model.",Yes
169-ARR,169-ARR_v1_review1_1@4,"Instead, they derive pseudo-feedbacks from gold labels, which causes a significant gap between their simulation and real-world interaction.",Yes
169-ARR,169-ARR_v1_review1_3@1,"1. Despite the well-motivated problem formulation, the simulation is not realistic.",Yes
169-ARR,169-ARR_v1_review1_3@10,"Therefore, the experiment results cannot support the claim made by authors.

",Yes
169-ARR,169-ARR_v1_review2_3@3,"2. The proposed approach heavily relies on how accurate the initial model is, which means it is highly sensitive to model initialisation, limiting its usefullness. 
",Yes

2-238,2-238_v1_report4016_4@0,"- The title for Figure 4 should be modified, since this figure contains only data for beta-tubulin.",Yes
2-238,2-238_v1_report4016_5@0,- In the main text the authors need to be much clearer regarding the rationale for looking at tubulin as a substrate. The authors may also wish to consider the possibility that the substrate specificity and/or activity may have been affected by the N-terminal tag and how this could be investigated.,Yes
2-238,2-238_v1_report4016_6@0,"- The discussion section should be revisited to remove the reiteration of the introduction and results. Instead, use this part of the paper to discuss the findings in relation to other published work.",Yes

7-229,7-229_v1_report32057_3@3,It seems like given the novelty of your approach that you need to provide an appendix highlighting how you do this and where this level of accuracy comes from.,Yes
7-229,7-229_v1_report32057_3@4,At a minimum I think you must let the reader know that this is an estimate and recognize there is error because I find it very unlikely that you can do this to a metre for every species.,Yes
7-229,7-229_v1_report32057_3@6,It is likely that such error is random between habitats but you have to make this an explicit assumption.,Yes
7-229,7-229_v1_report32057_4@0,The use of 20 minute point counts from the same day is very reasonable for richness and calling rates etc. But I have significant concerns about double counting of the same individual over that duration.,Yes
7-229,7-229_v1_report32057_4@1,Birds move and how a listener can track the number of individuals that occur over that interval is likely very problematic.,Yes

7-229,7-229_v1_report32057_5@1,Yet the figures do. You need to clarify the equations used to calculate beta in particular.,Yes
7-229,7-229_v1_report32057_5@2,How beta is computed needs to be described and the results described given the figure that includes it.,Yes
7-229,7-229_v1_report32057_5@3,No measurement of beta diversity that I have read would have the range you shown in figure 2 so clarification of how is essential.,Yes

7-229,7-229_v1_report32057_6@7,What I am not clear is whether or not the ADONIS test incorporates this repeated measure component.,Yes

7-229,7-229_v1_report32057_7@1,It is rather atypical so should be justified.,Yes
7-229,7-229_v1_report32057_8@0,The discussion fails to recognize the significant limitation of this study which is replication.,Yes
7-229,7-229_v1_report32057_8@2,Since most of the other variables build from alpha richness it is not particularly surprising that the null models fit the best.,Yes
7-229,7-229_v1_report32057_8@3,So making a really strong statement that there is no difference is not really a solid argument.,Yes

7-407,7-407_v1_report32577_16@1,What makes you think any studies were ‘missed’ and why did you then include the same time period – ie from 2008 to 2010 – if you are ‘adding’ to the data it would make sense to begin your inclusion time from 2010 unless you have evidence that some studies were ‘missed’?,Yes

7-407,7-407_v1_report32577_24@0,It doesn’t make sense to compare data from the current review to Mossbridge et al ‘if’ both sets of data contain the same studies – as this would lead to obvious similarities etc.,Yes
7-407,7-407_v1_report32577_24@1,To an extent this seems to be addressed by the data in Table 3 but not made clearly – ie why not simply state that when X studies were excluded due to Y reasons the overall effect was still significant?,Yes
